We do the practices so that children and families can achieve and sustain outcomes
Families and Communities (2)
Families around the world rely on basic community resources and supports that allow them to live and thrive - 
things like jobs and stores and schools and hospitals and homes and roads and all the things built and maintained by business people and government and people who contribute to the community they live in.
All of us depend on these resources and supports in our own community to build our own families, to raise our children, and to live our lives as best as we can.
But sometimes things happen in life that damage these community resources and supports and leave people unable to support themselves.
Natural and man - made disasters like earthquakes or war can destroy entire communities.
Famine and disease can weaken people so much that they can't take care of themselves.
And sometimes personal problems divide families and make them unable to care for themselves or raise children.
When people lose the essential community resources and supports they depend on, to get them back they must begin the process of rebuilding their family and restoring their connections to their communities
The Purpose of this Guidebook (3)
This guidebook is about rebuilding lives and restoring community resources at the family level.
It is at the family level that people make true and lasting connections to their community.
Even if outside organizations or agencies or governments come to save and rebuild a community, the people who live in the community must reconnect personally with all the essentials they need.
This guidebook is written to families and caring people who want to rebuild and strengthen their community.
We will walk you through the steps of restoring families in their communities 

The steps outlined here are neither complicated nor difficult - anyone can complete them.
We will begin with basic tasks to address your family's most basic needs.
While these may be simple tasks, they will require a lot of work and they may need you to ask other people to help you do them.
But asking for and offering help are two very important steps in reconnecting with your community, and when these tasks are completed you, your family and everyone who helped you will be better and stronger.
This guidebook is about helping yourself and helping others as you rebuild your community and your place in the community, together.
In the simplest terms, that's what a community is: a place where people live and work together to create positive lives for themselves and everyone else.

What do we mean by community? (4)
When we use the term community we mean three things:
1. The geographical area where people live in
2. Everyone who lives in that area.
3. Everything all those people do in the ordinary activities of everyday life.
In this guidebook, community includes the place you live in, you and everybody else who lives there, and all of the things you do.
We do not leave anybody out - in a strong community, everyone is recognized, everyone has a place, everyone matters and everyone contributes in their own way.
Basic home practices (5)
When we talk about basic community resource and supports, we mean all the things everyone depends on every day to help themselves and everybody else in their community.
When we talk about specific tasks you and others must do to rebuild and strengthen your ties to the community, we will focus on five key things that every family needs on order to thrive:
Sanitation - safe water, a clean home and protection from health hazards.
Nutrition - plentiful nutritious foods, especially for growing and developing children.
Health Care - access to quality medical and health services.
Education - schools and training programmes for people of all ages.
Economic Security - jobs and opportunities for families to earn and access all the things they need to live productive lives and to participate fully in the community.
We will talk about these five things as basic home practices that families can do to strengthen themselves and restore themselves and their community.

When disaster strikes (6)
Unless you have been through it, people find it difficult to imagine themselves in a true crisis.
But the unimaginable can happen.
In recent years we have seen devastating earthquakes in India, Iran, Pakistan that collapse cities, and a tsunami from Indonesia that destroyed communities all around the Indian Ocean.
There have been wars in the mid - East, famine in Africa, hurricanes and flooding in North and South America, and global Aids pandemic that has killed millions of parents in Africa and Asia, leaving behind millions of unassisted orphans.
A community can be destroyed in minutes, but it will take years to rebuild itself.
And families around the world experience their own personal disasters with the death or disablement of a family member, financial crisis, disease, drug addiction, divorce, mental illness or any number of serious problems that undermine the family's ability to take care of itself.
When disaster strikes, families must begin the long process of stabilizing, rebuilding and restoring their ties to all the basic resources and supports they need from their community.
Getting out of crisis (7)
In this guidebook we will explore the basic steps you can take to end the crisis threatening your family, stabilize the situation in your home, and begin to restore your ties to your community and strengthen your family and everyone around you.
These steps are presented in five chapters that describe the practical things you can begin doing immediately even if you have no money or no special resources or no outside help.
We will begin with the simple tasks to get your family out of crisis.
Next we will help you begin reconstructing your ties to the resources and supports that you and everyone else needs from your community.
And we will end with ways you can sustain and strengthen your ties to your community so that your family can grow and thrive as your community grows and thrives
In communities around the world today, people need to begin reconstructing or strengthening their communities in order to help families live well and raise healthy children.
This guidebook is for those people.
It will give you a place to begin and lots of things to try.
We will offer you many ideas, but you must do the work yourselves.
Outcomes for Children (8)
Basic Home Practices is a companion guidebook to Outcomes For Children, a discussion guide that describes ways to help children in your community be safe, healthy, living in a stable na nurturing home, in school and behaving well.
In most communities around the world, families make these things happen every day for children.
However, there are families in every community who experience hardships that make it difficult for them to care for their children - these families need help from other caring people in the community.
these families need help from other caring people in the community.
Outcomes for Children talks about things caring people can do to help families and children.
We suggest you use both guidebooks together as you work with your own children or someone else's family.
Outcomes and Practices Together (9)
The outcomes are all the things we all want for our children, and practices are things we can do to strengthen our families to achieve and sustain the outcomes.
Together, these two guidebooks help people do things they must do to strengthen their families and raise their children.
The most important thing to remember (10)
The most important thing to always remember in working with your family is that you will need all the practices to achieve all the outcomes.
You can't leave anything out - you must work on all the practices with your whole family.
Household development involves everyone who lives in your home;
from the youngest to the oldest, there is a role for everyone to help strengthen your family.
Your challenge is to find something for everyone to do, some way for everyone to contribute.
A holistic approach (11)
Many programmes concentrate on solving one problem like health or education or employment, and focus on one practice only.
But working on only one part of your family doesn't help in the long run - even if your family builds itself up in one area, other problems that don't get fixed will eventually undermine your efforts and pull your family back down.
The approach described in this guidebook puts all the pieces together into a holistic set of activities that work with your whole family to develop and support your whole household.
There is no single thing you can do that will solve every problem - you will have to do many things in order to strengthen your family.
Our aim is to help you develop whole children and whole adults in a whole family in a whole community

Helpful reminders (12)
Most of the things described here are things people do everyday.
But when a crisis comes, it may be difficult for people to think about everything that is going on.
they focus on the biggest problem at hand and forget about all the little problems that, if you fixed them, would add up to a big difference.
This guidebook will help you remember the little things that will help you manage a crisis.
When you work on the little things, you will find it easier to solve the big things.
A series of questions (13)
In the following discussion, we will ask you a series of questions about what is happening in your family right now.
Do your best to answer honestly.
It is more important to be honest about your family's needs - and work to improve them - than to try and conceal problems or try to look better than you truly are.
Every family has its problems, and every family needs to deal with their problems so that everyone in the family can be safe and happy and healthy.
And every family needs help from time to time to put together the resources and supports they need.
Please answer our questions as honestly as you can, and please try the things we suggest.
We believe these little things will help.
The practices and outcomes will help you achieve all the good things you and your family deserve.
So please work on all the practices and pay attention to all the outcomes.
Sanitation (14)
Sanitation is one of the most important services that a community can provide.
Without fundamental resources like safe water and sewage removal, people will always be exposed to serious health hazards and diseases that will keep them sick.
When sanitation is poor, someone in the family will always be sick and the family will not experience the level of health and well being that is possible with safe water and good sanitation.
In order to restore yourself and your family to good health, we must begin by solving the basic problems of unsafe water and poor sanitation.

Please think about the following questions, answer them honestly, and try the things we suggest.
They will work and they will make a positive difference in your family.
Is everyone in your family drinking safe water? (15)
Water is essential to life, but water that is contaminated with bacteria or germs is a serious source of illness or even death.
Sometimes water looks clean - it doesn't have dirty materials floating in it - but it is contaminated with harmful organisms or chemicals too small to see or taste that make it unsafe to drink.
People who drink dirty or contaminated water will always be sick, usually with diarrhea.
But most of this sickness will not o away simply by drinking and washing and cooking with safe water.
If you get water from a safe source like a protected well or a treated water system, your water may be safe enough to drink without any further treatment.
But if you get water fro a river or an open spring or a polluted well or some other unprotected place, you must disinfect your water to make it safe before you drink it.
Water from unprotected must be disinfected before you drink it or cook with it or bathe with it, or otherwise the organisms in the water will spread disease to everyone in your family.

Water can be disinfected by boiling or chemical treatment or filtering or ultraviolet sun rays.
If firewood and chemicals are not available, solar water disinfection - putting water in a 1 or 2 liter bottle and laying it in the sun all day .

may be the simplest way to change unsafe water into safe drinking water.
 rain water can also be collected in safe ways.
Throughout this guidebook, we will talk about using water that is safe, which means free of harmful things.
The most common way people around the world get sick is by drinking unsafe water.
And the easiest way to prevent water borne illness is to make sure water is safe before you use it.
Has everyone in your family bathed recently with soap and safe water? (16)
When people's bodies are dirty, they are vulnerable to many health problems from skin diseases to intestinal problems to depression and discouragement that comes from just not feeling clean.
A good place to begin improving sanitation in your family is to give everyone a bathe.
It may seem silly or simplistic, but just getting your skin and hair washed with safe water and soap can be soothing in addition to removing bacteria from your skin.
Where safe water is plentiful, some people bathe every day.
But if this is not possible, it is important to bathe at least once a week.
Children, who can get dirty quickly, may need to bathe more often.
Is all the clothing and bedding clean? (17)
Once a person is clean, it is important to get dressed in clean clothing and sleep in clean bedding.
Otherwise, the old bacteria that were washed off will return from dirty clothing and bedding.
Obviously, the best way to clean clothing and bedding is with safe water and soap.
Setting clothing and bedding outside to dry in bright sunlight is also an important step in the cleaning process.
After a person gets a bath, they should put on clean clothing.
Bedding can go a little longer between cleaning, although spreading it out in bright sunlight or shaking and beating bedding are easy ways to keep bedding clean between washings.
Is your home clean inside and outside? (18)
There are many different kinds of homes around the world that are made from many different kinds of materials, all of which require special cleaning.
Wherever you live, you probably know how to clean your home
the challenge is to clean it often enough to prevent insects or diseases building up.
Most important of all is to get rid of trash and old food that is breeding ground for insects and bacteria that can make your family sick.
Is the floor clean? (19)
Whatever type of floor you have in your home, there is a way to clean it.
If your home has a dirt floor, there is a proper way to clean it.
If your home has rugs or carpet, it is especially important to clean out dirt and other things that work their way into the material.
Small children who sit or crawl on the floor are especially vulnerable to the mold and bacteria and worm larvae that can build up on the floor.
Keeping the floor clean will help keep your children healthy and well.
Is the sleeping area clean? (20)
Along with cleaning and airing out the bedding, it is important to clean up trash and clutter in the sleeping area.
Again the goal is to get rid of insects and bacteria that spread disease and illness.
Is the cooking area clean? (21)
For your family to be healthy and well, you need to eat clean food that is properly cooked.
This means keeping the cooking area clean.
Scraps of food are a breeding ground for bacteria and insects that cause and spread disease and illness.
Keeping the cooking area clean will help prevent the spread of disease and illness through food poisoning.
Is the toilet area clean? (22)
Human feces contain some of the most dangerous germs and bacteria that cause severe illness like typhoid, cholera, and dysentery that can lead to death, especially among young children.
It is important that you keep the toilet area clean.
There are many different kinds of toilets in the world and there are ways to clean all of them -
 it may be necessary to clean the toilet in your home every day.
Is the area in and around your home free of feces? (23)
Sometimes human or animal feces exist out in the open, in or around a home.
These feces are extremely dangerous and they spread harmful illness and disease.
As the rest of the home gets cleaned, it is essential to make sure that there are no feces in or around your home.
This may require cleaning up and burying human and animal waste in a safe place where no one will be exposed to it.
It is important to keep human waste away from any water source, such as a well or spring.
If feces get into your water supply, everybody in your family will be exposed again and again to all the dangerous diseases that are spread through contact with human feces.
Is your family's food stored safely? (24)
It is important to prevent food from being contaminated by old rotting food or other filth in the home.
Every home can and should have a safe place where food is stored.
Wherever you live, there is a right way to store food to keep your family safe from food poisoning.
To protect your family, follow your community's rules for properly storing and cooking food.
Sanitation - keeping your family safe and clean (25)
Many people never think about the importance of safe water, clean bodies, clean homes and safe food.
But without these basic steps in sanitation, the whole family - and even the whole community - will never be able to achieve the many good things we all want for ourselves, our children and our families.
Many of the tasks we have talked about require hard work, but these are things most families can do on their own.
However, if you are injured or ill, you will need to ask someone to help you.
Some people are too proud to ask for help, but asking for help is one of the best ways there is to help build your community.
And when you offer to help someone else, you are truly building your community.
This is the simplest and best definition what a community is all about: people helping people.
Nutrition (26)
The human body runs on food and water.
With the right combination of nutritious food and safe water, people can stay healthy - especially children, who need food to grow and how must have a healthy diet capable of helping their growing brain develop as they get older.
If you and your family, and especially your children don't eat a balanced diet from a variety of foods with extra vitamins for children, you will not have the energy and strength and good health to live the fullest lives possible.
Good nutrition is very important to staying healthy and strong and smart.
Think about the following questions and begin doing the things we suggest here in order to improve the quality and variety of foods your family eats.
Is everyone on your family eating a variety of foods? (27)
There is no food that contains everything that a person needs to be healthy.
Every different type of food has a different combination of nutrients in it, and people - especially children - need to eat a variety of foods to get all the nutrients they need to grow and thrive.
You need to learn about the different food groups and the amount of food from each group that your family should eat every day to stay health.
There are as many different ways to group foods as there are communities.
But most foods can be grouped in the following categories;
Vegetables
Fruits
Starches, staples, cereals and grains
Legumes and nuts
Food from animals, milk, meat and proteins
Fats and oils.
Look for food in your community that fit into the different food groups, and organize your family's meals to eat a balanced diet that includes at least one food from every food group at least once a day.
Sometimes it is difficult for a family to get the full variety of foods they need - some foods might not be available or they might be too expensive, or the family might be too ill or troubled to grow them or to shop for them.
You may need to ask someone to help getting the variety of foods your family needs.
And you may be able to help another family get the variety of foods they need.
Remember that helping others and asking for help is what building your community is all about.
Do the children eat before the adults eat at mealtime? (28)
In some cultures children are expected to wait until the adults have finished eating before they are allowed to eat.
If there is a shortage of food in a household, this can mean that children are not getting enough of the right foods they need to grow and thrive.
Children's growing bodies and brains have the greatest need for a complete and nutritious diet, and they should be allowed to eat before adults - otherwise they might not get enough of the right foods they need to grow up healthy and strong and smart.
Since children to not eat as much as adults, there should be enough food left over for older people after the children have eaten.
If there is not enough left for everyone else after the children eat, then your family will need to get more food for the household.
Do children in your family take vitamins and minerals every day? (29)
Even the best food may not contain all the essential vitamins and minerals that children need to grow and that sick people need to recover from illness.
Vitamins and mineral supplements are probably available somewhere in your community, and one challenge is to get them for your family.
It is important to take the correct vitamins in the correct amounts you need every day.
Taking too many vitamins at one time may make a person sick instead of making them grow or get well.
Do you know the signs and symptoms of malnutrition? (30)
If a member of your family, especially a child, does not enough of the right foods, they can become malnourished.
The signs and symptoms of malnutrition in children include;
Weight loss and a thin appearance
Failure to grow
Failure to sit or walk or talk or learn
A big stomach with thin arms and legs
Dull or thin hair or copper colored hair
Too tired or weak to work or play or study
Dry skin or skin sores, especially in the mouth
Frequent illness.
If a child in your family has some of these signs or all of these signs and symptoms, they must be examined by a medical service provider.
If your child is malnourished, your family will need to improve their diet.
Does everyone in your family know how to prepare food correctly and safely? (31)
The safest food to eat is food that has been fully cooked and served hot, or food that has been properly cleaned with safe water.
If food is stored so long, bacteria will grow and anyone who eats this spoiled food will become sick from it.
Every community has ways to safely prepare food.
It is important to follow the positive traditions and practices in your community that keep your food safe.
Your whole family will benefit from food that is correctly cooked and stored safely.
Does everyone in your family drink safe water only? (32)
As we discussed in the earlier chapter on sanitation, safe water helps people stay healthy and strong, but unsafe water makes people sick and weak.
It may require extra effort to get safe water or to disinfect unsafe water, but the advantages are worth the effort - and the risky of illness from drinking dirty water very high.
It is important not drink unsafe water.
If a person drinks safe water all the time, but still drinks unsafe water now and then, they will still be exposed to all the dangerous diseases that are spread through unsafe water.
Help your family understand the danger of drinking even a small amount of unsafe water.
Nutrition - helping your family eat well (33)
Nutrition is an essential practice for you, your family and your community.
Remember the basics of nutrition: everyone needs to eat a variety of foods - eat at least one food from every food group at least once a day.
Make sure your children eat enough of all the good food they need.
Give your children - and anyone in your family who is ill - vitamins and minerals every day.
Learn the signs and symptoms of malnutrition and prevent it from happening in your family.
Prepare all food correctly and safely.
Drink safe water only.
The better everyone in your family eats, the better you and your family will live.
Health Care (34)
Health care is a key resource that families in every community depend on.
Without access to health care, illness or injury can be very devastating to a family.
Think about what happens when one person in your family gets sick - someone has to take care of the sick person, the sick person can't work or contribute to the family, and a child may have to stay home from school to provide care.
One thing leads to another and, without health care to help one person to recover, the whole family soon ends up in crisis.
Even if health care is available, if the cost is high the family may have to go without other important things in order to pay for treatment.
On the other hand, there are many helpful forms of health care that a family can provide on its own, especially in preventing health problems before they occur.
Let's talk about some of the key health practices your family can do with no outside help.
Again, please think about the following questions, answer them honestly, and begin doing the things we suggest to improve health care in your family.
Does everyone in your family regularly wash their hands with safe water and soap? (35)
Some of the most common family illnesses are the easiest to prevent simply by improving basic family hygiene.
If everyone in your household washed their hands with soap and safe water before cooking or eating, half of the illness in your home would end.
Most every day illness is caused by bacteria and germs that are spread by unwashed hands, especially when one uses the toilet or wipes their nose and then cooks or serves food or eats without washing their hands.
Even touching your own unwashed hands to your face can make you sick.
If everyone would wash their hands with safe water and soap, your family's health would get better immediately.
Keep safe water and soap where everyone can use them, and encourage one another to wash your hands.
If you see someone not washing their hands when they should, remind them to do it for the good of the family.
Is anyone in your family infected with lice, scabies or other insects? (36)
Children especially are very vulnerable to tiny insects like lice, scabies and chiggers that cause huge health problems and skin diseases.
Yet these pests can be eliminated from a home with some hard work, thorough cleaning and some medicine.
At the first sign of infestation, start cleaning and treating everyone in the family.
Prevention is the best strategy for lice and scabies and other annoying insects.
Keeping your home and bedding clean will help prevent infestation.
Do you let fresh air into your home to clear out smoke? (37)
In many communities people cook on open hearths that fill the home with smoke.
And some people in families smoke tobacco inside the home, exposing everyone who lives there to the dangers of second had tobacco smoke.
Smoke is a main cause of many respiratory illnesses like asthma, and it harms everyone's health - household smoke is bad for everyone in the home, especially children.
One way to eliminate smoke is to simply air out the home by opening doors and windows to let air in that blows out smoke.
If possible find a way of moving the cooking fire outside the living area in your home.
And get any tobacco smokers to smoke outside.
Or better yet, get them to stop smoking since that is the source of very serious health problems that harm people.
Families without smokers are healthier than families that smoke.
And when people stop buying tobacco, they have more money for their family.
Are sick people infecting others in your family? (38)
Many everyday illnesses are easily passed from one person to another, and sometime an illness like diarrhea or a cold can get passed around and around in the family.
Whenever one person gets sick, that person and the whole family should make sure that they don't pass on their illness to anyone else.
The simplest way to stop the spread of illness in your family is for everyone to wash their hands more often.
It may be necessary for a person with a contagious sickness to stay away from other family members - especially your children - till they get better.
Do you store food safely and properly? (39)
One of the main causes of family illnesses is eating bad food.
One simple way to prevent food - born illness is to make sure that food is stored properly - this includes keeping food dry and in a closed container where animals and other pests cannot get into it.
We talked about storing food safely under the sanitation practice - this is another example of how one practice affects another.
Does everyone sleep in a bed that is dry and off the ground? (40)
When people sleep on bare or wet ground, they are exposed to germs and insects and moulds that cause respiratory illness, skin diseases and other health problems.
The diseases are easily prevented by sleeping on dry beds off the ground.
If people in your community prefer to sleep on the floor, get or make everyone a thick and waterproof mat that will prevent things on the floor from harming you while you sleep.
Is every bed covered by a treated bed net? (41)
In areas affected by malaria and other mosquito - born diseases, everyone in the household should sleep under a bed net that has been treated with insecticide.
The bed net will not only protect the person sleeping under it, it will also kill any mosquitoes that touch it, thereby reducing the number of mosquitoes in the area.
If your family cannot afford a bed net for every member, look for a local programme that gives away bed nets for free - organizations around the world are working to prevent malaria and other mosquito - related diseases by giving bed nets.
All they ask is that you keep them and use them, which is one important health care practice your family can do on your own.
Does your family know how to identify serious illnesses? (42)
While there are many types of health care that your family can practice on your own, there are situations where you need outside help from a medical care provider or a traditional healer in your community.
It is important that everyone in your family learn to recognize illnesses and injuries that require outside health care.
Most diseases have symptoms or warning signs that tell you that a person is ill and needs treatment.
Your family should learn how to identify the most troublesome illnesses including dehydration, malnutrition, malaria, asthma, diarrhea, and other diseases that happen where you live.
All these illnesses are preventable and may be easily treated if you identify them early and get outside health care quickly.
When someone in your family needs outside health care, the sooner your family recognizes the need and gets the person to outside care, the better.
It is also important that everyone in your family get a regular examination by a medical care provider who checks your general health, your height and weight, your eyesight and hearing, your teeth and your overall well - being.
Children may need a check - up more often than adults, but everyone should be checked from time to time.
Does your family know how to prevent serious illnesses? (43)
We have talked from the beginning of this guidebook about the power of prevention - that a lot of problems can be solved before they happen.
Sanitation, nutrition and health care all fit together when your family makes the effort to prevent common problems that happen in families.
Your family can do things on your own to prevent health care problems or to treat them early before they require outside health care.
However, when someone needs outside health care, it is important to identify the signs and symptoms of serious illness or injury so that they can get outside medical care as soon as possible.
Health Care - helping your family stay well (44)
Let's review some of the health care practices we have talked about: the most common illnesses that affect families can usually be prevented easily.
Simply drinking safe water, washing your hands often, and carefully preparing food will prevent half of all diarrhea problems.
Bed nets and a cleaning sweeping area will prevent malaria and many respiratory and skin problems.
A smoke free home is a healthier home.
Good nutrition with vitamin supplements will prevent malnutrition and help people stay healthy.
And it is important to recognize serious health problems quickly in order to get outside health care quickly.
If your family follows these simple health care practices, you will be healthier and everything else in your family will get better, too.
If your family needs help with health care, ask someone in your community to help you.
Asking for help and offering to help others - builds your community and strengthens your resource and support system.
Education (45)
Education opens the door to the future for children and families.
It prepares children for life in their community, and it is a way for adults to gain the knowledge and skills they need to stay successful in a rapidly changing world.
Although most people think about school and education programs as things that happen outside the home, education is an important practice that families can work on themselves, both to support school programs and foster a commitment to life - long learning for every member of the family.
The following questions and activities will help children and adults get the education they need to strengthen their family and their family's ties with the rest of the community.
Does every school - age child in your family attend school every school day? (46)
To get a complete education, children must attend school on time every school day - there is simply no other way to keep up with their classmates.
Unfortunately, many things can happen in the family that can prevent children from attending school.
It is important to identify and solve the various problems that keep children away from attending school.
Let's talk about some of these barriers to education.
Sometimes children don't get enough support or encouragement from families to go to school.
Or a child has to stay home to take care of a family member.
Or a child has to go to work instead of school in order to earn money for the family.
Or a child may be too ill to attend school.
Or a child might have caused trouble at school and is no longer allowed to attend.
Or a child's family may be too poor to pay school fees and costs.
Or a child may be too hungry to go to school.
Or a girl who is menstruating may not be allowed to attend school.
Or a girl may be pregnant and drop out of school.
For every one of these problems there is a solution.
Some are easy to solve while others are difficult.
For instance, if someone in your family needs extra care, perhaps a neighbor or a friend can help out during school hours so all your children can attend school.
If your family needs an extra worker, perhaps the work can take place outside of school hours.
If your child misses school because of illness, someone can bring home their homework for them to work on so they don't fall behind.
There is always a way to solve any attendance problem, if your family is willing to put in the extra effort to allow all of your children to attend every school day.
But many attendance problems come from a deeper problem in the family - the adults don't value education and they don't encourage their children to succeed in school.
Without good education, the younger generation will not be prepared for work in the community and they won't be as successful in supporting the family.
In the long run, it is in the best interest of your family to help every child in your family get a good education, even if it means that adults in your family - you have to do more work until your children grow up and finish school.
Education is a very important practice - it is as important as sanitation and nutrition and health care because it improves your life in the community, and it contributes to your family's economic security.Without a good education, a person will have economic problems instead of economic security.
Education depends on all the other practices, and all the other practices depend on education.
As we have been saying all along, all the practices work together, and you must work on every practice so that your family can succeed.
Does your family need help to pay school fees and cost? (47)
If lack of money is the barrier to your child's school attendance, your family might need to ask for financial help, or you might need to find a way to earn additional money to pay for school costs.
Perhaps there is a local fund in your community that can help pay school fees and costs so your children can attend school.
It might be very difficult for your family to ask for help.
But education is essential, and once your children complete their education, they can pay back the community by helping some other family pay fees or perhaps they can use their education to help the community.
People all around the world get financial help to pay for their education by agreeing to work in their community after they finish school.
This is an honorable way to pay back an education debt.
It is also an excellent way to help build a community.
Does your family help your children succeed in school? (48)
Children need a lot of help and support from their family to succeed in school.
They need help completing their homework.
They need a quiet place to study.
They need to eat enough food and get enough sleep so they can pay attention in class.
They may need help waking up early in the morning and getting ready for school.
And they may need help to decide what they want to be when they grow up, and encouragement to keep working toward their educational goal.
Sometimes parents don't have the knowledge or training to help their children with their homework, especially if the parent grew up during the time when education was not available.
Perhaps an older child in your family or a neighbor's child can help your child with school work you don't understand.
Sometimes your child's teacher can help you find a tutor for your child.
And there is always the opportunity to finish your own education - it might take a lot of work and a long time to finish, but many adults go to school themselves to finish their basic education or to learn new skills that can help them in adult life.
Do the babies and very young children in your family learn something every day? (49)
From the moment they are born, children need to be stimulated with new sights and sounds and sensations so that their brain will grow and develop.
Every child needs daily stimulation, nutritious food, love and nurture, and someone who will talk to them or sing to them or read to them or show them how things in the home work.
Even if they are too young to walk or talk themselves, babies and young children learn by hearing and watching other people around them, and they learn by tying new things - something as simple as holding a safe object in their hands will help your child's brain grow and develop.
The sooner your child begins to learn, the better your child will grow.
Do the adults and older people in your family learn something every day? (50)
Just as children need to learn new things every day, so do adults and people of all ages.
The world is an enormous place and no one ever learn everything about it - there is always another important to new thing to learn.
When families value education as a process of life - long learning, everyone benefits.
Think of all the reasons for learning throughout your lifetime.
You can learn new skills in order to get better at the job you have.
You can improve your reading skills in order to keep up with all the news and information about your community and the rest of the world.
You can learn new things in order to help your children or your grandchildren make choices in a rapidly changing world.
You can get answers to questions you have always wondered about.
And you can be a role model for others in your community who will see your interest in long - life learning and be motivated to keep learning themselves.
Whatever your reasons, education is an essential practice - you, your family and your community will benefit from everything you learn.
Education - helping your family learn (51)
Let's review the practice of education in your home.
Every child in your family needs to attend school on time every school day.
If your family needs help to pay fees, ask for help, and make sure your children pay back your community after they complete their education.
Help your children succeed in school.
Teach your babies and you children at least one new thing every day.
Encourage everyone in your family to be a life - long learner.
Economic security (52)
All the practices work together and none can be left out.
They all depend on each other.
Economic security depends on having strong family practices in sanitation, nutrition, health care and education - and all these practices depend on a family's economic security.
As before, please think carefully about the following questions, answer them honestly and try the things we recommend.
We believe these steps will improve your family's economic security.
Does everyone in your family have a task that helps support the family? (53)
In addition to the work you do to earn a living and support your family, there are many tasks that need to be done around your home.
When your whole family works together to complete these tasks, the main workers in the family can concentrate on what on what they do best - earning a living for the family.
Everyone in your family from the youngest person to the oldest should have a task they can do that contributes to your family that gives every person a place and a voice in the family.
Think about all the small tasks we have been talking about - things like cleaning and shopping and cooking and making water safe and helping with the homework.
All these need to be done every day to strengthen your family, to keep it strong, and to make it easier for you to go to work or grow food or sell something or do whatever it is that you do to support your family.
Even a family member who is too young or too old to go out and earn money for the family can contribute to your family's economic security by working on the practices inside your home.
Whether their job involves earning money of growing food or keeping the household running or freeing up someone else for an economic task, there is a way for everyone in the family to contribute.
And all those jobs working together will improve your family's economic security.

Does your family have back - up support to get through an emergency? (54)
Sometimes things happen that financially overwhelm a family - someone loses their job or gets injured or sick and can't work.
Throughout this guidebook we have talked about ways you family can recover from a crisis, so you already know a lot about putting your life back together.
But troubles come and go, and it is important that your family have a plan and people you can rely on to help you get through an emergency.
Sometimes families make partnerships with other families to help one another with cooking or child care or cleaning or transportation.
These arrangements are what community is all about;
people helping people get through the good and bad times that come in life.
These ties to your community lay the foundation for the economic security of your family.
Sometimes families exist from hand to mouth, barely getting by with few resources and supports they have.
But from time to time, it is possible to set some money aside to help in an emergency.
As impossible as it might sound when your family is barely getting by, saving money for the future is possible, even if only in tiny amounts.
Perhaps you can set a little money aside from time to time just in case someone gets sick, or something breaks down and you have to replace it.
Having a little savings set aside can help you get through the next crisis that always seems to be coming down your road.
Or perhaps there is something that your family needs that you can't afford right now, but you can afford it if you saved for a few months.
If you build up your savings and you don't need the money for a crisis, may be you can use part of it to buy something wonderful for your family.
Every family deserves a treat now and then, and if you can set aside a little money every week or every month, your family can experience the pleasure of something special.
One measure of the strength of a family is its ability to get through a crisis without falling apart.
Your family can strengthen itself by building relationships with trusted friends and neighbors, and by setting aside little savings.
Does your family have ways to increase your family income? (55)
As your family recovers from hardship and disaster it becomes more and more possible to improve your family's economic situation.
Things stabilize and you have more time and energy to look ahead to the future and to make plans for yourself and your family.
You might think about getting a job or a better job or getting more education - or just having more time to do the things you have always done to support your family.
Once the practices are working in your family, you can start doing new things - even things that might take you a long time to accomplish - that will increase your family's economic security.
Here is something to think about - this is probably the central question for everything we have been talking about in this guidebook: what can you do right now with the resource you have and the people you know to increase the economic security of your family?
 Is there a job you can do better than anyone else?
 Is there a way you can grow more food to sell or trade for the things your family needs?
 Is there something you could make that a lot of people want, something you could make better than anyone else in your community?
As things begin to stabilize in your family, and as you begin to experience the benefits of all the practices, it might be time to move toward your dreams and hopes and some of the things you want for yourself and your family.
Of course it is wise to take one step at a time, but now that your family is getting out of a crisis you were in, it's okay to think about ways to increase your family's income.
You have put in a lot of hard work rebuilding your family and strengthening your ties to your community.
It is good to dream a little and to move toward some of the good things in life that you and your family deserve.

Economic Security - helping your family thrive (56)
Let's do a quick review of the practice of economic security.
There is a role for every member of your family in building up your family's economic security.
It is important to make partnerships with other families to help one another, especially in times of crisis.
Save a little money as often as you can.
Look ahead to the future, think about something you have always wanted to do, and begin moving toward it.
From the family to the community (57)
Although many development programs try to build up a whole community all at once, true community development begins at the individual family level.
Development can only succeed at the community level when families are succeeding at home.
Our approach begins at home - we believe that home development is the foundation for higher level development.
When the home is stable, people are available for development at the community, regional or national levels.
Most families take care of themselves most of the time.
But there may come times when any family needs help from outside.
This guidebook is about ways families can help themselves.
It is about ways families can ask for help when they need it.
Even if you don't have enough to provide for your own children - or especially if you don't have enough - you and other families in the community can benefit by reaching out to one another and helping one another in any way you can.
The basic home practices that we have talked about in this guidebook include things that anyone can do, whether or not they have enough to meet the needs of their own family.
These are things you can do for your self and for your neighbors, and that they can do for you.
Anything you do, no matter how small, will make a difference for your family and your community.
Some communities have so many problems that every family is struggling just to meet the basic needs of their children.
It is in these communities that families need to work together and help one another the most.
As we said in the beginning of this little book, community is the place where people live and work together to create positive lives for themselves and everyone else.
This guidebook is all about building community and this approach is a simple as you and me and everyone else working together to take care of our families.
We wish you the very best of luck as you and your family and your friends and neighbors work together to build a better community.
We admire and honor and respect your determination to move ahead with your lives.
If you have benefited from anything we have offered here, we only ask that you share those benefits with others you meet in life, and especially with people who are struggling to rebuild their families.



Take good care of yourselves, your families and your community

SPECIAL INFORMATION SECTION (58)
HAND WASHING
Frequent hand washing is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
The most important thing you can do to keep from getting sick is to wash your hands.
By frequently washing your hands, you wash away germs that you picked up from other people, from contaminated surfaces, or from animals and animal waste.
What Happens If You Do Not Wash Your Hands? (59)
You pick up germs from other sources and then you infect yourself when you touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
One of the most common ways people catch colds in by rubbing their noses or eyes after their hands have been contaminated with the cold virus.
You can also spread germs directly to others or onto surfaces that other people touch.
And before you know it, everyone around you is getting sick.
The important thing to remember is that, in addition to colds, some serious diseases like typhoid, hepatitis A, meningitis and infectious diarrhea, can easily be prevented if people make a habit of washing their hands.
Wash you hands before you: (60)
 Prepare or eat food
 Treat a cut or wound
 Tend to someone who is sick
And wash your hands after you: (61)
 Go to the toilet
 Handle uncooked foods, especially raw meat
 Eat
 Blow your nose, cough or sneeze
 Handle garbage
 Care for someone who is sick or injured
 Change a baby that is wet (urine/stool)
 Play with or touch an animal
How Should You Wash Your Hands? (62)
Wet your hands with safe water and soap.
Place the bar of soap on a rack and allow it to drain.
Rub your hands together briskly for at least 20 seconds.
Start rubbing on your fingers and slowly work up to your wrist and forearm.
Pay close attention to your fingernails, the areas between your fingers and the back of your hands.
It is the soap combined with the scrubbing action that helps dislodge and remove germs.
Rinse thoroughly with safe water.
Dry your hands by shaking them or letting them drip dry.
If drying with a cloth towel, make sure it is clean and not previously used.
OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN (1)
DISCUSSION GUIDE
The purpose of this guide
The purpose of this discussion guide is to help you determine whether or not a child is safe, healthy, at home, in school and behaving well;
and whether or nor the child's family needs outside assistance to achieve these things.
This guide will walk you through a series of questions you can ask and indicators you can look for that can help you understand what is happening in a child's life.
And it will help you think through ways you and other caring people can support families as they care for their children.
A different approach to helping children (2)
The outcome approach described in this guidebook differs from conventional child and family programs in two major ways:
Working with the whole child (3)
First, most conventional programs focus on one problem area - either safety or health or home life or education or community behavior.
Most conventional programs concentrate on only one part of a child's life.
Working to achieve outcomes (4)
The second way this approach differs from conventional child and family programs is that other programs tell you what specific service you should provide.
The approach described in this guidebook doesn't tell you what service to provide;
it tells you what you must accomplish with children and families.
It tells you what outcomes children are supposed to achieve, but it lets you decide what specific actions you will take - in partnership with families - to achieve those outcomes.
Where to go but not how to get there (5)
This guidebook tells you where you need to go, but it does not tell you how to get there.
You have to figure out on your own what action makes the most sense for each child and family.
That does not mean that you are out there on your own with no idea what to do - this guidebook won't tell you what to do, but it will help you decide what needs to be done.
It will help you think of things you could try.
And once you get going, it will help you determine whether what you are doing is working.
What works in your community and culture (6)
This guide will help you find out what helps children and families in your community, based on how things work where you live and what resources are available.
It will help you identify ways to help kids and families that match the culture, language and values of your local community.
Working with the family (7)
Our goal is to partner with families and other caring people in the community so that families can keep their children safe, healthy, at home, in school and behaving well.
We are there to help and participate on the family's terms and in ways that suit their needs and their goals for themselves and their children.
What you will learn (8)
This discussion guide will help you and other people who care about children and families think about and talk about each outcome and each indicator.
You will explore four things:
1. What does each indicator mean to you and to others in the community?
2. What does each indicator "look like"?
That is, what things or behaviors will you look for to know if an indicator is true or not true?
3. What can you do - using the resources and the people you have today - to help families to achieve every indicator for their children?
4. What resource and supports will you have to look for or develop in your community to help families achieve and sustain the outcomes on their own?
How you will begin (9)
You begin this process by reading through this guide, thinking about each indicator, and then writing down your own idea in your own words.
Once you have answered the questions for yourself, you will meet with others to talk as a group about what these things mean to you - and what they mean to your community.
What the indicators mean to all of you (10)
Your first goal in this process will be to come to a common understanding about the outcomes and the indicators - what the words mean and what the indicators look like in the life of a child and his or her family.
This does not mean everyone has to agree on every point - you can see things in different ways.
You and your partners in this process will probably agree on many things and disagree on a few others;
that's fine.
The difference between how you and your partners see things will enrich your collective understanding and make the work you do together better than anything you could have done alone.

Your goal will be to bring together a group of people from different backgrounds and with different perspectives who are willing to work together with families to support them - on the family's terms - as they help their children achieve the outcomes.
Working together to achieve all the outcomes (11)
It is essential that all the 20 indicators be addressed for every child.
Working on one or a few indicators isn't enough - ultimately, all the indicators need to be true.
Because no none person alone can help a family achieve all indicators, you will have to work with other people who share your concern about kids and families and who have different skills and interests.

Caring partners (12)
You probably know other people who are willing to add their experience and abilities to this effort to help children and families.
Some may be professional service providers who can give help in specific ways.
But you don't have to be a professional to work with kids and families - you just have to care.
The most important thing you can offer a family is a caring and supportive personal relationship during their time of need.
Caring - along with some practical common sense and willingness to try things - will accomplish remarkable outcomes among children and families in your community.
Working with the system (13)
Some of the families you may work with may already be receiving services form public or private agencies.
Most agencies offer very helpful services, and most professionals are very good at what they do.
Unfortunately, many agencies work separately, with each agency doing its own thing and putting its separate requirements and expectations on the family - this often increases confusion in the families experience, adding to their existing problems.
In order to help, rather than hinder, you must find ways to work with family and with the system.


This will probably be challenging.
But if you all focus on the full set of outcomes and indicators, combining your efforts into one set of services for the whole family, you are more likely to be helpful to the family and the family is more likely to succeed.
Getting started (14)
The first step in this process is simple.
All you have to do is begin reading and working through this guidebook, thinking and talking and listening to other people like yourself who want to do something meaningful with kids and families in your community.
Once you begin, everything will begin to fall into place, and before you know it you will be working with families and you will see positive outcomes happening with kids.

OUTCOME #1: SAFE (15)
The Safe Indicators
All children deserve to be safe in their home and in their community.
The best way to find out whether or not a child is safe is to look at what is going on in a family, especially things that adults in the home are doing to ensure a child's safety.
The simplest indicators of child safety are that the child is:
1. Cared for and protected
2. Not being abused or exploited
3. Keeping himself or herself safe.
Let's walk through these indicators one at a time.
Keeping himself or herself safe.
1. Cared for and protected (16)
At its most basic level, caring and protecting children means feeding them, making sure they have clothing they need and a safe place to live, helping them grow and learn, looking out for them, and showing them love.
But there are many other ways to care for and protect a child.
Think about other things people might do to take care of and protect a child - write them in the space provided below.

Is a child being cared for and protected? (17)
If you want to find out whether or not a child was cared for and protected, you might look for certain kinds of behavior or things in the child's home.
For instance, if care for a child means someone must feed them, you could look to see if there is enough food in the home.
Or you could find out what kinds of clothing or shoes the child has.
And you could watch for ways the adults in the home protect children from dangerous objects like sharp knives or hot stoves.
And you could for ways adults show love to the child in the way they act and talk.
If you visited a family in their home, what are some other things or behaviors you might look for that would indicate that a child was being cared for and protected?
Write them down.
Why look at a family situation? (18)
Our purpose in asking questions and looking at what is going on in a family is to help them care for and protect their children.
We are not just snooping around to find things wrong;
we are trying to find ways to support the family.
We are trying to find ways to help.
Often adults do a very good job caring and protecting their children on their own, but sometimes they have a hard time and they might need help.
Our goal is to help the family in ways that the family wants and on the family's own terms.
Respecting the family (19)
It is important to be respectful to the family and to remember that they are probably doing the best they can.
You might have really good ideas about different things a family could try, and it may be tempting to suggest things they should do.
Nevertheless, there may be things going on that you don't understand, and your good ideas could just add to the pressure they are under and make things harder for them rather than help.
It is rarely helpful to tell someone what they should do, especially when they are struggling.
Put yourself in their position and think about how open you would be to some stranger telling you how to take care of your kids.
What does the family want? (20)
Rather than tell a family what to do, it much better to ask them what they want and ask them what you might do to help them.
If you find that the family is having trouble caring for or protecting their child, ask them "Is there anything I can do to help you?
Something small that would take off some of the pressure?" If they accept your help, do your best to honor their request.
If they say they don't need help, or they don't want help, honor that too in a friendly way.
Sometimes the best way we can help is simply to let the family know we care.

May be later, after we have demonstrated our care and concern and respect for the family, they will be willing to ask for help to care for and protect their children.
2. Not being abused or exploited (21)
Being safe also means that a child is not being abused or exploited.
There are three kinds of abuse - physical abuse, sexual abuse and emotional abuse - and all are hurtful to the child.
Some adults use too much physical force to discipline or punish a child, causing physical injury that leave bruises and serious wounds.
Sometime adults take advantage of children sexually.
And sometimes adults threaten children or say things that hurt their feelings and make them feel bad about themselves.
Abuse of any kind is unacceptable, and sometimes outsiders have to intervene in a family to stop or prevent a child from being abused.
If you think a child is being abused (22)
If you observe an injury to a child that could have been caused by abuse, you must ask someone who is familiar with child abuse to come and check the child.
Child abuse is complicated to deal with and if you think it is going on, it is important to ask for help rather than try to handle it on your own.
And obviously, the worst thing to do would be to ignore it or pretend that it didn't happen.
What about exploitation? (23)
There are different kinds of exploitation.
Sometimes adults treat children like servants, or make them do things that an adult should be doing, or make them do things children shouldn't do.
As with child abuse, if you think someone is exploiting a child, you must ask someone who is familiar with child abuse to come and check the child's situation.
Advocating for children and families (24)
Child abuse and exploitation are very serious.
As caring people, we are expected to report suspected abuse and exploitation to authorities who are experienced and authorized to intervene.
We must become advocates for children who may not be able to speak out for themselves.
And we also must be willing to reach out to families without being judgmental if we are going to help them find positive ways to keep their children safe.
3. Keeping herself or himself safe (25)
Children - especially older children - make choices about the situations they place themselves into.
It is important that they keep themselves safe.
One good way to determine whether or not a child is safe is to look at how a child takes care of herself or himself.
Are they keeping themselves out of situations where they could be injured?
Are they staying away from behavior that could harm them?
Dangerous situations and behaviors (26)
Think about situations and behaviors that could be harmful or hurtful to a child, and think about ways that children might keep themselves safe.
Write down some of the dangers that children face.
Now write down a few things children can do to keep themselves safe
Think about behavior you might look for to tell whether or not a child is keeping herself or himself safe.
Helping children keep themselves safe by example (27)
It is one thing for adults to protect children, and it is something else for children to protect themselves.
Children need to take care of themselves, and one way they learn to do this is by looking at adults around them.
If adults are modeling safe behavior, then it is more likely that children will do the same.
This is one area where concerned people can have enormous positive influence on children - we can help by taking good care of ourselves as an example to other families and children.
Keeping children safe (28)
At its most basic level, keeping children safe requires that adults care for and protect them and prevent them from being abused and exploited, it requires that children look out for themselves.
Most of the time families are able to keep their children safe, but some times they need help.
Based on what we have talked about so far, what are two or three simple things you could do to help a family keep their children safe?
What are some other resources or services you might need to find - or develop - in your community to help families keep their children safe?

Putting the pieces together (29)
Compare your list of things you could do and resources you could need with the things and resources other people have written on their lists.
When you put all your lists together, you will discover that - together - there are lots of things you can do to help families keep their children safe.
OUTCOME # 2: HEALTHY (30)
All children deserve to be healthy.
The simplest indicators of child health are that the child is:
1. Free of illness
2. Happy with life
3. Free of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs
4. Not sexually active
5. Eating nutritious food every day
6. Receiving the basic necessities of daily life
Let's look at these indicators one at a time.
4. Free of illness (31)
One indicator of a child's health is that he or she is free of illness.
Child illness can include many different health problems, from a simple cold to a life - threatening disease.
It can range from infection to injury and from malnutrition to obesity.
And it can involve physical problems or dental problems or emotional problems.
The free of illness indicator doesn't distinguish between one illness and another - instead it focuses on wellness.
The point of this indicator is that a child should not be experiencing any untreated health problem.
Diagnosing and treating childhood illness (32)
Although some symptoms of childhood illnesses can be easily observed by almost anyone, deciding whether or not a child is free of illness may require an examination by health professional.
Unfortunately, professional health care is not always available - 
a child may live in a remote area where there is no medical care, or the cost of care may put it beyond the reach of the child and family.
The first step in addressing a child's healthy needs may simply be helping them get to a health care provider.
Urgent medical care (33)
Sometimes children experience life - threatening illnesses or injury that requires immediate medical attention.
It is important to learn how to identify urgent medical needs so that in a medical emergency, we can help the family take immediate action to protect their child's health.
Emotional or mental health (34)
Sometimes children experience emotional or mental difficulties that require professional medical or mental health care.
Emotional illness may be as easy to see as physical illness, and families may be too ashamed or embarrassed to talk openly about it.
But help is often available to children and parents who are experiencing emotional or mental health troubles, if they seek it.
One important way you can help a family with emotional or mental health needs is to encourage them to seek mental health care, and follow up to make sure that the care they receive is truly helping them recover from their difficulties.
What does wellness look like? (35)
What are some things or behaviors you might look for that would tell you whether or not a child is free of illness?
Write them down.
What are some possible barriers that can prevent a child from getting access to health care?
What are a few things you might do to help a child and family access health care?
Breaking the barriers (36)
Even if we do not have the medical training necessary to address a child's health needs, we may be able to help the child's family break the barriers that prevent them from getting health care.
Our goal is to help the family keep their children free of illness - sometimes the most important way we can help is to open the way to medical, dental or mental health services

5. Happy with life (37)
One of the simplest indicators of a child's health and well being is whether or not the child is happy with life.
Happiness is something anyone can see in a child, and its absence may be equally easy to see.
Children often display their feelings about the situation or circumstances they are in - if they are in a good situation they show it through happiness, and if they are in a difficult situation they may show it through sadness, anger or misbehavior.
And sometimes children in unhappy situations hide their feelings altogether.

Deep happiness and resilience (38)
Children who feel safe, who feel they are valued, and who have good relationships with adults around them usually experience a depth of happiness that can get them through tough times.
Resilience - the ability of children to bounce back from adversity - is a powerful force in every child's life.
Loss of happiness (39)
Sometimes children experience profound loss or trauma that takes away their happiness.
The death of a parent or a traumatic experience is not easily overcome, and a child may need years of love and support to recover.
One very important way we can help children to healthy is simply to be available to them on their terms, helping them be safe and letting them know that they matter to us.

What does happiness look like? (40)
What are some of the things or behaviors you might look for that would tell you whether or not a child is happy with life?
What are some ways you might help a child and a family regain that deeper happiness that helps children get through difficult times?
What are some ways you could help a child who is already happy with life stay happy and healthy in spite of difficulties that may come along?
6. Free from alcohol, tobacco and other drugs (41)
For children to grow and develop into healthy adults, their bodies need to be free of toxic substances that inhibit brain development or that cause physical or emotional problems.
Alcohol, tobacco and other illicit drugs all cause significant physical and emotional harm to growing and developing children and youth.
There is simply no positive place in a child's life for substance use.
This includes direct use by children and youth as well as second hand exposure to substance use by others around them.
Prevention (42)
The best approach to keeping kids away from harmful substances is prevention - either by making alcohol, tobacco and other drugs difficult to get or by helping children decide on their own not to use them.
When children feel safe, when they have good relationships with caring adults, and when they believe they are a valuable member of their family and community, they are less likely to get involved in unhealthy and harmful activities like substance abuse.
Make your expectations clear (43)
It is important to let your children know your expectation that they be free of alcohol And since kids are always comparing the things adults say with the things they do, we should think about our own behavior with regard to alcohol, tobacco and other drugs and what mixed messages we may be sending to the kids and families we are hoping to help.

Helping kids make healthy choices (44)
What are some behaviors or things that would show you whether or not a child is free of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs including secondhand exposure?
What are some ways you could help a child make healthy choices about substance use?
And what are some ways you could help families keep their children free of substance use and exposure?
7. Not sexually active (45)
Sex can be a wonderful and positive part of adult life, especially for people who have developed the ability to form healthy and committed relationships.
But there is no place in healthy child development for children or youth to participate in sexual relationships.
There is much evidence that children and youth who are sexually active are also experiencing problems in school, at home and in the community - sexual activity is a strong indicator of other problems.
On the other hand, kids who are not sexually active typically are experiencing positive things in all other areas of life.

HIV/Aids and early parenthood (46)
The risk of HIV/Aids and other sexually transmitted diseases make sexual activity a health - threatening - and life - threatening - behavior.
Also, early pregnancy reduces the life options of youth who may have quit school in order to raise a child.
On top of all that, children of teen parents are more likely to grow up poor, less healthy and to experience developmental problems that affect them throughout their life.
Prevention (47)
As with substance use, the most straightforward approach is preventing children and youth from becoming sexually active.
Prevention might mean keeping track of where kids are and what they are doing.
Or it might mean them positive opportunities to do other things.
Or it might mean helping kids decide on their own to postpone sex until adulthood.
Abstinence or safe sex (48)
People spend a lot of time arguing about the best way to deal with child sexual behavior.
Some believe that abstinence is the best approach while other believe that some kids are going to be sexually active anyway so it is better to teach them about safe sexual practices or give them condoms.
Whatever your beliefs, it is important to focus on the big picture, rather than get trapped in arguments with people who do not see things your way.
Our goal is to help families keep their children safe, healthy, at home, in school and behaving well -
 there may be many different ways to help families deal with child sexual activity.
What if the family sees things differently? (49)
You may find yourself dealing with a sexually active youth - or with their parent - who sees things differently from you.
Perhaps you may find ways of maintaining a positive influence with the youth and the family and encourage them to make healthy choices.
Or maybe you will need to ask someone else to help the family in this area.
Either way, the best approach is to be honest and open about our personal beliefs, understanding that it is up to the family to decide what to do.
If you can maintain a relationship of honesty, respect and concern, the family and the youth are more likely to listen to your views.
Child sexual abuse (50)
Earlier in this guidebook we talked a little about child sexual abuse.
This is a topic that most people find difficult to deal with.
Nonetheless, we need to recognize that a tragically high number of children - both boys and girls - are sexually abused, and we need to acknowledge our responsibility to be strong advocates for children who may be unable to defend themselves.

If we encounter a situation where we believe that an adult is having any type of sexual relationship with a child, we must report this to someone in authority who is familiar with child abuse.
Reporting suspected sexual abuse may harm our relationship with the family, but we are obligated to intervene to protect the child.
Perhaps later, someone else will be able to re - establish a positive relationship with the family and help them get moving forward again.
What does "Not sexually active" look like? (51)
What are some things or behaviors that you might look for that would tell you whether or not a child or youth is sexually active?
What are some ways you might encourage a child or youth who is not sexually active to postpone sex until they reach adulthood?
What are some ways you could help a family deal positively with a child who is sexually active?
8. Eating nutritious food every day (52)
A nutritious diet is essential to the healthy development of every child.
The basics of child nutrition are simple: children need a balanced diet from a variety of food groups including grains, vegetables, fruit, milk and meat.
However, children need different foods at different stages of development, and different communities may have access to different types of food.
And some foods may be too expensive for some families, or culture and tradition may dictate the kinds of foods families eat.

And some children are allergic to some kinds of food.
Learning about child nutrition (53)
It will be important for you to learn about nutrition for children in different age groups so that you can determine whether or not a child is eating well enough to support their current stage of development.
Nutrition specific to the community you are in is available through local health educators, health publications and the internet.
Pay close attention to cultural factors in family eating, since religion and tradition may have a strong influence on diet.
And pay attention to the cost of food, since a family cannot sustain a diet they cannot afford.

What types of food are available where you are? (54)
Different communities may have access to different types of food.
One important step will be to determine the nutritional value of foods available locally.
Knowing what nutritious foods are available will help you help families and children eat nutritious food every day.
Good nutritional diet for breastfeeding mothers (55)
Breastfed babies usually have better health outcomes, both in healthy development and reduced illness.
It is important that a breastfeeding mother eat a nutritious diet in order to produce enough breast milk for her child, and in order to maintain her health so she can care for her child in every other way.
Vitamins and food supplements (56)
Sometimes children need extra vitamins and minerals to round out a nutritious diet.
Often, vitamins and food supplements are available to children at low cost.
In order to ensure good child nutrition, you may have to help families access the resources they need to deal with the problem of "hidden hunger" - the damage and developmental problems caused by vitamin and mineral deficiency.
Model good nutrition (57)
As with most other aspects of life, children watch what adults eat, comparing what adults say with what they do.
If we don't eat as we should, kids and families we are trying to support probably won't either.
Help your community develop nutritional resources (58)
One important role we can perform in helping families provide nutritious food for their children every day may be to help the local community develop its food capacity.
This could involve improving food distribution, especially to families that cannot afford high - prices food.
Or it could involve educating people about the importance of good nutrition.
Or it could involve helping local people grow, raise and exchange different types of food.
What are some ways you might better prepare yourself to help communities and families feed their children nutritious food every day?
What are some other resources or agencies you could partner with to help your community develop its food capacity?
9. Receiving the basic necessities of daily life (59)
We have already talked about many of the things children need every day - care and protection, healthy behavior, nutritious food, and lots of love and attention.
The last indicator is a kind of "catch - all" to make sure that we have not left anything out.
And like several other indicators we have discussed, the basic necessities of daily life may be different for different kids in different families in different communities.
Let's look at a few remaining loose ends that will help families keep their children healthy.
Material necessities (60)
We have talked about how caring for a child means making sure they have the clothing they need and a safe place to live in.
What are some other material or physical basic necessities of daily life children in your community need to be healthy?
Immunizations (61)
Many of the most dangerous childhood illnesses can be prevented through vaccination and immunization.
Sometimes, however, parents have difficulty maintaining their children's immunizations, either because of the high cost of medical care or lack of access to it, or because they don't fully understand the importance of disease prevention.
And some parents don't immunize their children because of religious beliefs.
It is important to help families understand that childhood immunizations are basic necessity of daily life, and that children whose immunizations are not up to date are very vulnerable to life threatening illness.


Love and nurture (62)
Perhaps the thing that children need most of all is someone who will love and care for them every day.
Emotional healthy is as important as physical health, and it is up to the adults involved in a child's life to provide the positive emotional support all kids need to make the physical support complete.
Sometimes the most important thing we can give to a child is time.
Usually, this doesn't take much effort on our part, other than to stop whatever else we are doing and focus completely - even if it is for a few minutes - on the child.
We need to tell our children every day that we love them, and we need to spend time with them every day on their terms doing something that they want us to do.
What are some ways you might help families provide the basic material and emotional things their children need every day?
It's is not as overwhelming as it seems (63)
Helping families keep their children healthy can seem like an enormous task, especially when you think about all the elements of child health.
But, as we have seen so far, it mostly involves a lot of little tasks, ordinary things that most families do every day.
The best way to help families keep their children healthy is to surround them with people who are willing to help on the family's own terms.
And that may be the best part of doing this work - we all benefit when we get to work together with a lot of caring people.
OUTCOME # 3: AT HOME (64)
The At Home indicators
All children deserve a home to live in.
Every child should be:
4. Living in a safe and nurturing home.
Getting along with everyone at home.
Let's walk through both of these indicators.
10. Living in a safe and nurturing home (65)
Under the safe home outcome, we have already talked about children being cared for and protected, not being abused or exploited, and kids keeping themselves safe.
The living in a safe and nurturing home indicator places the safe indicators into the home where the child lives and adds nurturing to the family relationship.

Nurturing (66)
Nurturing means providing all the support a child needs to grow and thrive and do well.
It involves emotional support, love, encouragement as well as providing the basic material things we have already discussed.
What are some behaviors and things you could look for in a child's home that would tell you whether or not a family was nurturing their child?
Adequate housing (67)
This indicator also speaks to a child's need for a standard of living adequate for the health and well being of the whole family, including food, clothing, housing, medical care and necessary social care services, and security if something happens that threatens the loss of their home.
Unfortunately, sometimes families are forced to live in housing that doesn't meet their basic needs.
What are some of the things you might look for in a home to determine whether or not it is adequate for to meet the child's and family's needs?


Homelessness (68)
Sometimes children lose their homes due to circumstances beyond their control, perhaps through family financial problems or illness or the death of a parent.
One important way we can support families is to help them keep the home they have or find another one if they become homeless.
What are some things you might do to prevent a family from losing their home, or to help them find another place to live in?
Removing children from their home (69)
Sometimes the only way to protect a child from misconduct by their parents may be to remove the child from his or her home.
And sometimes the only way to protect the community from misconduct by the child is to remove the child from the home.
Removing a child from their home can be devastating to the child and the family.
If it becomes necessary to remove a child, it is essential that every effort and resource be made available to the child and family to correct the problems and restore safety for everyone, and return the child home as soon as it is safe and healthy to do so.

Finding new homes for children (70)
Sadly, some children will never be able to return to their natural home.
The best solution under these circumstances is to find another family to raise the child.
Unfortunately, many children who cannot return to their natural families bounce from one family to another, never settling into a home they can call their own.
Some families open their own homes to children through adoption or permanent foster care.
It takes a special family to commit themselves to keeping these children safe, healthy, at home, in school and behaving well as they grow up - and to maintain a life - long family relationship with the child.
11. Getting along with everyone at home (71)
Most families find ways to get along with one another, including ways to resolve their disagreements and conflict.
It is normal for people, especially if they live together every day, to have different expectations that sometimes may make it difficult to get along.
What are some things you might look for in a family to determine whether or not a child is getting along with everyone at home?
What are some ways you might help a family work out ways to get along with one another?

Serious family conflict (72)
Sometimes families have so much conflict that they need help from outside the family to learn better ways to get along.
What are some other agencies or resources in your community you might partner with to help children and families develop better ways to get along with one another?
OUTCOME # 4: IN SCHOOL (73)
The In School Indicators
Every child deserves an education.
It is also in the best interests of the whole community to make sure that every child learns everything they need to succeed, to support themselves and to contribute to their community.
For children to get the education they need, they must be:
7. Attending school
8. Obeying school rules
9. Succeeding in school
10. Participating in activities with other children
11. Getting along with everyone at school.
Let's take a closer look at each of these indicators.
12. Attending School (74)
To get adequate education, a child must attend school.
School may be public or private, or it may be home school - the place doesn't always matter.
What matters is that a child be in a structured learning environment that can meet all their learning needs at every stage of their development.
Barriers to attending school (75)
Unfortunately, some children face barriers that prevent them from attending school.
They may be forced to stay home to take care of younger brothers and sisters so that their parents can go to work.
Or they may have to stay home to take care of a sick parent.
Or they may be forced to go to work themselves to earn money to support the family.
Or a child may be so seriously ill that she or he cannot attend school.
Sometimes, even if they attend, children may not have all the materials they need, or they may not have eaten enough nutritious foods for their brain to learn, or they may be too troubled by other problems to pay attention.
There are many barriers that prevent kids from attending school or learning.
What are some things you might look for in child's home and at school to determine whether or nor a child is attending school in every way?
What are some things you might do to help a family ensure that their children attend school?

13. Obeying school rules (76)
School is often the place where children learn to get along in their community.
In addition to learning academic subjects, children learn the basic rules of courtesy, how to cooperate with others, how to discipline themselves and follow instructions and they learn respect for authority.
School rules and community rules (77)
A child's ability and willingness to obey school rules is often an early indicator of how they will behave later in life.
If they learn to follow rules in school, then they'll be more likely to follow the rules out in the community.
What would you look for to determine whether or not a child is obeying school rules?
What might you do to help a family to help their children obey school rules?
14. Succeeding in school (78)
Success in school is often measured by the grades children receive in the subjects they study.
Children need to learn a variety of subjects and they need to get good grades in them all.
What are some ways you might use to determine whether or not a child is succeeding in school?
Education support from the family (79)
One of the most important things children need in order to succeed in school is support from their family.
Parents need to show their children that education is important - 
they can do it by getting their children to school every day on time and ready to learn, and by making sure that children have a time and a place to complete their homework.
Sometimes families need extra support in helping their children succeed in school.
What are some things you might do to help parents support their children's school success?
Learning disabilities (80)
Some children have learning disabilities that prevent them from learning the way other children learn.
Unless the school finds special ways to teach these children, they are not likely to succeed in school.
Some learning disabilities like vision or hearing problems may be fairly easy to discover and solve if teachers and parents are paying attention to a child's learning experience.
However, other learning disabilities may be more difficult to see.
And sometimes the schools do not have the resources or skills to meet a child's special learning needs.
A child with learning problems may be seen as a troublemaker, rather than a child with special learning needs.
The school may need help working with a child, and the child's parents may need help working with the school to create a learning situation that will meet the child's needs.
What other organizations in your community might you need to partner with to help a child, the child's parents, and the child's school create a learning environment for a child with a learning disability?
15. Participating in activities with other children (81)
Education is not just about learning facts by yourself -
 it is also about learning and working together with others, and it is fun being a member of something larger than yourself.
That's the part of going to school that prepares children to be successful members of their community.
What are some things you might look for to determine whether or not a child is participating in activities wither other children?
Finding and developing positive activities for kids (82)
Sometimes there aren't enough activities for children to participate in and they end up hanging on their own.
Or, positive activity programs exist but kids don't have a way to get there, or the family cannot afford to pay for them.
Often, children get into trouble when they have too much unsupervised time.
One of the best ways we can support children, families and the community is to help find or develop adult - led activities for children and make it easy for kids to participate in them.
What are some ways you might find or help develop activities for kids in your community?
16. Getting along with everyone at school (83)
Another way to tell whether a child is doing well in school is to look at their relations with other students and with their teachers.
Kids need to develop relationships with other kids, and they need to work through the ordinary personal problems that come with having friends.
It is healthy for children to disagree - and it is healthy for them to get over their disagreements and go back to being friends.
School is a place where kids develop relationship skills that will help them throughout their life.
What are some things you might look for to determine whether or not a child is getting along with everyone in school?
What are some ways you might help families help their children get along with everyone in school?
OUTCOME # 5: BEHAVING WELL (84)
The Behaving Well Indicators
Every child and youth is responsible to themselves, their family and their community for their behavior.
Several key indicators of behavior in the community are that a child is:
5. Obeying all rules
6. Behaving well in the community
7. Friends are behaving well
8. Helping others in the community
We need to take a closer look at each of these indicators
17. Obeying all the rules (85)
Most children obey the law, not because they understand all the rules, but because they understand the difference between right and wrong and they want to do things right.
But sometimes kids do break the law.
Usually children and youth who break the law are having problems in other areas of life - they may be angry and acting out or they may be experiencing emotional problems they can't control.
Or they may simply be choosing to do something they know is wrong.
Protecting the community (86)
It is important for families and members of the community to stop children from breaking the law, to find out what is going on, and to correct the child in the way that is most likely to both protect the community and move back the child to obeying the law.

We have to protect the community from law breaking behavior, but if we can also get a child back to follow the law, then we can avoid a lot of problems later.
Preventing problems or solving them before they become serious is much better - and much less expensive - than dealing with serious crime later on.
What are some you could find out whether or nor a child is obeying all the laws?
What are some organizations you might partner with in your community to help children obey the law?
18. Behaving well in the community (87)
We all expected to behave well in our community - not only to obey the law, but to treat everyone and everything in our community with respect.
Sometimes children behave poorly in the community without breaking the law, by being disrespectful toward people or property or creating disturbances, or by disobeying their parents.
Misbehavior is always an indicator of problems in other areas, and sometimes is a predicator of bigger problems in the future.
Community behavior is one area where adults can have a powerful positive influence on children.
We can demonstrate the kind of good behavior we expect from children and praise children when we see them behaving well.
And we can speak out when we see children doing unacceptable things.
Children may not always appreciate our praise or criticism, but it can have a positive effect on how they act.
What are some things you might look for to determine whether or not a child a child is behaving well in the community?
What are some ways you might help families help their children behave well?
19. Friends are behaving well (88)
Another indicator of how a child is doing out in the community is the behavior of his or her friends.
Kids often go along with whatever their friends are doing - if their friends are behaving well, they are likely to behave well themselves, and if their friends are getting into trouble into trouble then they are likely to get into trouble too.

It is important that children learn how to choose and keep friends who will make it easier for everyone to behave well.
What are some ways you might determine whether or not a child's friends are behaving well?
What are some ways you might help a family pay attention to their children's friends, and help their child choose friends who are behaving well in the community?
20. Helping others in the community (89)
Everyone needs to contribute to their community in their own way.
There are many opportunities for children to help others in the community - they can do small chores that help older people, or they can look out for younger children or they can help clean the community.
The more children feel that they are valuable members of their community, the better off they will be.
One important contribution we can make to our community is to find meaningful ways for children to contribute.
What are some ways you might determine whether or not a child is helping others in the community?
What are some ways you might help children contribute to your community?
The most important job there is (90)
From the beginning of human history, people have been getting together to help one another.
One of the oldest and most important jobs that communities have always done is to help families raise their children.
But some communities have forgotten how to help one another raise their children.
Our purpose in this outcome process is to learn - again - how to help every family keep every child safe, healthy, at home, in school and behaving well.
It is not difficult to do - it requires that caring people reach out to families in helpful and positive ways.
And the best way we can teach our children the importance of helping others is to help others ourselves.
We all benefit when children - and adults - help others in our community.
Putting all the indicators and outcomes together (91)
Let's review some of the basics we have been talking about in this Outcomes for Children Discussion Guide.
We serve the families (92)
We are not here to replace the family in raising their children.
Our role is to support families on their terms and in ways that suit their needs, culture and desires.
It won't help if we force parents or their children to do something they don't want to do.
We can offer our help and support, but families get to choose to whether they will accept it.
Honor the privacy of the child and family (93)
Once you begin to work with a family, you will learn very many private things about them that are very sensitive and potentially embarrassing.
If this information gets out it will probably harm the people you are trying to help, and it will probably destroy your relationship with the family.
We have talked about the requirement to report child abuse or exploitation to people in authority who are trained to protect children - 
we are obligated to report when families are mistreating a child.
But aside from this, we cannot share private information with people outside the family group we are working with, not even people close to us.
We must keep this information confidential.
Think about how you will feel if someone disclosed personal information about you.
Pay attention to all the 20 indicators (94)
It is tempting to focus on one or a few indicators and ignore the rest - 
many programs that serve kids and families make this mistake, only working one part of a child's life.
But kids need to achieve all the outcomes and indicators together.
We need to think about the whole child in the whole family in the whole community.
It takes a lot of work, but this is the only way we can truly help children and families.
Even if we can only work with the family in a few ways, we still need to pay attention to the whole set of indicators and think about all aspects of the child's life.
No one person or agency can do it all (95)
It takes a lot of people and a lot of resources to raise a child.
We probably encounter other caring agencies and other people who are working with our families - we need to work together with them so that the family can get all the support they need to raise children.

People who try to do this work alone usually fail.
We must work with others.

Working with the family and other agencies will take a lot of communication and negotiation - and mostly a lot of patience - with others who may see things differently from the way we do.
We need to be flexible with others and with the family to be helpful.
Strengths are as important as needs (96)
Even the most troubled child or family will be successful in some things.
Look for indicators that are working, acknowledge them, and build on them as a foundation for transforming areas of need into areas of strength.
We are not helping families fix problems, we are also helping them reinforce and build on the good things they can accomplish by themselves.
Pay attention to yourself and your own family (97)
It does little good to sacrifice your own well - being or your own family relationships, even for a cause as noble as helping kids and families.
The outcome and indicators apply to our families as much as they apply to anyone else.
As you move out to help and support other people's children, remember to keep your own kids safe, healthy, at home, in school and behaving well.
And ask for help for your own family anytime you need it.
Remember always that we are all in this together.
The Outcome for Children Scoring Form (98)
The child outcomes and indicators are listed together on the Outcomes for Children scoring form, 
along with places to fill out personal information about the child, a set of scoring "bubbles" along the right hand side of the form and a scoring guide at the bottom.
The purpose of this form is to help you document the status of any child at any time with regard to the five outcomes and twenty indicators.
There is a copy of the Outcomes for Children at the end of this book.
You have permission to make photocopies of this form for the purpose of scoring children you are working with.
Child information at the top of the form (99)
The form asks you to write down the child's name, the scoring date, the name of the person or persons who are filling out the form, the name of the program or organization that is serving the child and the child's date of birth, ethnicity or clan and gender.
All of this information is important in keeping track which form goes with which child.
Child's name (100)
In order to keep track of a child as her or his situation changes, you need to write the child's name on the form.
Some children go by more than one family name, so it is important to make sure that you get the child's full name.
Some programs prefer to use a number for a child to ensure the child's privacy.
If you use a number, make sure you keep a muster list with each child's name and the number you are using to identify them.
Scoring date (101)
The scoring date refers to the specific day you have picked to score the child's situation.
The scoring date must be different from the date you are filling out the form.
For instance, if you are describing the child's situation on March 1 that will be the scoring date, even if you are filling out the form on March 10 or some other date.
When you first begin to work with a child or family, it usually takes several weeks of contact with them to learn anything you need to know about their indicators.
The first time you score the form, the scoring date should refer to the first day you began to work with the family, even if you are filling the form several weeks later.
The goal is to describe the child's situation on the first day.
Later on, when you fill out the form again to show any changes in the child's situation, you pick another scoring date and fill out another form.
That way you can compare a child's scores with their later scores to determine whether or not their scores are changing.
As you work with a child and family, you will probably fill out a new form every few months to keep track of any changes they may experience.
After you collect several forms for a child, you will be able to look back at the old forms and see what is changing in the family.
Form filled out by (102)
It is important to write down the names of the people who are scoring the form so that, if there are any questions about the score, you can go back and talk to whoever filled out the form.

Although one person might fill out the form by themselves, the most accurate scores come from the whole group of people who are working with the child and the family - including family members themselves.
When several people are looking at the child's situation, and they all participate in filling out the form, the scores will be probably more accurate.
Program (103)
Often, there are many programs working in one community, all doing different things with children and families.
One good way to look at how all the programs fit together is to compare scores from different programs.
The purpose is not to say that one program is "better" than another.
Rather the purpose is to see which children in which situations are being served by different programs so that all programs can learn from each other's successes.
When you compare scores from different programs, you see the whole system is working across your whole community.
Child's date of birth, ethnicity or clan and gender (104)
Because children experience different levels of development at different stages of life, it is important to know a child's date of birth.
That way, you can see how children are doing at different ages, and you can compare the situation of one child with situation of another child of the same age.
The child's ethnicity or clan also may affect both the help they receive and the benefits they experience.
And girls and boys often experience different things as they grow up, so it is important to keep track of the child's gender.
Looking at children by age, ethnicity or clan and gender will help you develop programs that work for boys and girls of different backgrounds at different ages and stages of their development.


The Scoring Guide (105)
In filling out the scores for each child, we are interested in three important things about every indicator: Is the indicator true?
Is the family getting outside help?
And does the family need outside help?
Is the indicator true? (106)
First, we want to know, Is the indicator true at this time?
That is, as we look at the twenty indicators one by one, is each indicator happening for the child?
For example let's look at indicator # 1, Cared for and protected.
Based on what you know about a specific child's situation, you are being asked to decide whether or not he or she is being cared for and protected on the date you have chosen to score the form.
In order to decide whether or not the indicator is true, you must use your judgment based on what you know about the child's situation.
This is where it is best to get everyone who is working with child and family - including the family themselves - to talk about what is going on and to decide as a group whether the indicator is true or not true.
Usually you can get the group to agree on a score.
If someone disagrees, then you must talk about what is going on with the child and try to reach an agreement.
If you absolutely cannot agree, then you can either vote or score the indicator based on the most votes, or you can leave the indicator blank.
Remember that this is only a score on a piece of paper - it is not important enough to argue over, although it is important to keep talking why different people see the indicator in different ways.
Sometimes the best discussions happen when people are trying to decide what is really going on with an indicator.

Is the family getting help with the indicator? (107)
Second, we want to know, Is the family getting outside help for this particular indicator at this time?
Again, using indicator # 1 as an example, is the family getting help from an outside program to care and protect the child?
Use your knowledge of what is going on to decide whether or not a program - either yours or another one - is helping the family care for and protect the child.
Again, it is helpful to get everyone who is working with the family together to fill out the scores.
That way you can all learn who is getting help or not getting help for each indicator.
Does the family need outside help right now? (108)
The third thing we want to know is whether or not the family needs help with a specific indicator right now.
If you decide that an indicator is not true, you must decide whether or not the family needs outside help right now.
If, for example, you decide that the child is not cared for and protected, you may need to do something right now to help care for and protect the child - especially if the child is in a dangerous situation.
One very important part of the scoring process is to identify emergency situations where people outside the family need to step in and help right away.
Sometime we may have to drop other things we are doing in order to help a child or family when they are in a crisis.
Five possible scores for an indicator (109)
By answering the three questions discussed above, we can give each indicator a score from 5 to 1. The Scoring Guide at the bottom of the form explains each score:
5 points: The indicator statement is true for this child with no outside help to the family.
4 points: The indicator statement is true for this child with outside help to the family.
3 points: The indicator statement is not true for this child but the family is getting outside help.
2 points: The indicator statement is not true for this child and the family is not getting outside help.
1 point: The indicator statement is not true and the family needs outside help right now.
To score the indicator, you simply fill the "bubble" at the right end of the indicator.
The most points for the best situation (110)
The most points go to indicators where the family is making it happen by themselves, and the least points go to indicators where the child is in crisis.
The scores also show improvement where a child begins in a crisis (1 point), then gets out of a crisis (2 points), then the family gets outside help (3 points), then the indicator becomes true because of the outside help (4 points), and finally the family doesn't need outside help any more because they can keep the indicators true by themselves (5 points).
Every indicator one by one (111)
Scoring the form means that you and the family and your partners talk about every indicator one at a time, deciding what the score is for each one.
Filling out the scores can take a lot of time when you first start working together, but it is a very good way to get acquainted and find out what is going on in the family.
After you have been working together for a while, the scoring process will get easier and will take less time.
Usually people fill out a new form for the child every two or three months to keep track of the changes that are happening in the family.

Comparing new scores with past scores (112)
Having past scores to look at helps the family and all of its partners see the changes they have made over time.
By comparing old and new scores, you can decide what is working and what isn't working, and you can talk about trying new things or bringing in new people to help.
And if an indicator is up to 4 or 5 level where the family is making the indicator happen all by themselves, we can talk about ending some of the ways you have been helping the family.

Scores may go up or down (113)
Although most families show improvement and get higher scores as time goes by, sometimes things don't get better as quickly as we wish they would.
And sometimes things happen that make scores go down.
Scores that stay down or go down don't mean that someone is being bad or not doing their part - it means that what you have tried so far is not what the family needs and you should think about trying something else.

Honesty and accuracy (114)
The most important part of filling out the form is to make sure that the scores are as accurate as possible whether they are high or low.
Of course we want every child to be at the 5 level, but sometimes improvements happen very slowly.
If a family is having a difficult time and their scores are low, it is important to tell the truth so that they get the help they need.
This isn't a contest where the person with the highest scores wins - this is a very serious effort to accurately and honestly describe what is going on in a family so that we can help them in the most appropriate way.
Storing scoring forms in a safe place (115)
It is important to keep all your scoring forms in a safe place where they won't be damaged and where they can be kept confidential.
The information on the form is very personal and sensitive and it is your responsibility to make sure that the family's privacy is protected.
Most programs establish rules and procedures about keeping files and records confidential.
The outcome forms are as important as any other record you collect and it is essential that you guard them carefully.

Analyzing scores and evaluating programs (116)
The outcomes scores for the children and families you serve can be combined in a computer database that will let you statistically study the changes achieved by your program.
If you are unable to analyze your data on a computer, you can still use the scores to think about the overall impact your efforts are having on children and families you serve.
Thinking about and studying the outcome scores will help you and your community get better at helping families keep their children safe, healthy, at home, in school and behaving well.
