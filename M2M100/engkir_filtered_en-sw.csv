"Meanwhile his disciples urged him, “Rabbi, eat something.”","Batarashika, abigishwa baramwinginga, bati Mwigisha, enda fungura."
Thus the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true.,"Kuko mur’ ivyo ari ho iri jambo rimenyekanira kw ar’ iry’ ukuri, ngo Habiba umwe, hakimbura uwundi."
And because of his words many more became believers.,"Hizera abandi benshi baruta aba mbere, kuko bīyumviye ijambo ryiwe;"
After the two days he left for Galilee.,"Iyo misi ibiri ishize, avayo aja i Galilaya."
"“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.","Asangwa nishingira intahe, intahe yanje ntizoba ar’ iy’ ukuri;"

You are my friends if you do what I command.,"Mur’ abakunzi banje, ni mwakora ivyo mbagera."
This is my command: Love each other.,Ivyo ndabibageze kugira ngo mukundane.
Whoever hates me hates my Father as well.,Ūnyanka aba yanka na Data.
"about sin, because people do not believe in me;","ivy’ icaha, kuko batānyizeye,"
