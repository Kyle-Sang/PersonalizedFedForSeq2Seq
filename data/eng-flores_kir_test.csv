Late on Sunday, the United States President Donald Trump, in a statement delivered via the press secretary, announced US troops would be leaving Syria.	Mw'itangazo yashikirije ku wa mungu amasaha yitereye, Prezida wa Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika yamenyesheje biciye ku muvugizi wiwe yuko inteko z'ico gihugu zizova muri Siriya.
The announcement was made after Trump had a phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.	Trump yabitangaje aho amariye kuvugana kuri telefone na Prezida Recep Tayyip Erdoğan wa Tirikiya.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but provides details fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.	Ivyo biremeza iciyumviro gikwiragiye cane c'uko dinozoro zari zifise amoya bikongera bigatanga amakuru ibisigarira bidashobora gutanga, nk'amabara n'imero ivyo bikoko vyari bifise ubiravye impande zose.
. Scientists say this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.	Abahinga bavuga ko amoya y'ico gikoko yari afise ibara ry'akagajo rizize haruguru, epfo rikaba ribenjutse, rija gusa n'umuhondo.
The find also grants insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.	Ico kintu catowe kiradufasha gutahura ingene ihindagurika ry'amoya y'inyoni ryabaye.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have other features of feathers — barbs and barbules — the researchers inferred the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development that these other features.	Kubera ko amoya ya dinozoro adafise agati k'umugongo gakomeye mugabo akaba afise utundi duhimba tw'amoya, nk'udushami n'udushamishami, abashakashatsi bashitse ku ciyumviro c'uko agati k'umugogo k'amoya kabonetse mw'ihindagurika inyuma y'utwo duhimba tundi.
The feathers' structure suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not a chick's down.	Ingene ayo moya ameze bisa n'ivyerekana ko atakoreshwa mu kuguruka ahubwo ko yakoreshwa mu kurimbanya ubushuhe n'imbeho canke mu kwiyerekana. Abashakashatsi bavuga ko naho uwo murizo ari uwa dinozoro ikiri nto, amoya yarabiweko akuze, si utwoya tw'igiswi.

This is called a chemical's pH. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.	Ni ico bita pH y'ikintu c'uburozi. Murashobora kubirabira kumutobe wishu ritukura.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.	Umutobe w'ishu ritukura uhindura ibara bivanye n'urugero rwa aside canke baze (alakaline) ikinyaburozi cifisemwo.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the tested chemical.	Urugero rwa pH rwerekanwa n'urugero rw'ama ions ya Idrojene (H muri pH) mukinyaburozi cageragejwe.
Hydrogen ions are protons that had their electrons stripped off them (since Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).	Ama ions ya idrojene nama proto ama erectro yazo aba yakuweko (mugihe ama atome ya Idrogene yiyunga na proto hamwe na erectro).

When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.	Igihe uhamagaye umuntu ari ku ntambwe igihumbi kure yawe, uba uriko urakoresha ikigendajuru.
The satellite in space gets the call and then reflects it back down, almost instantly.	Ikigendajuru mw'isanzure cakira ihamagarwa, hama kikarisubiza inyuma, nk'icarimwe.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth’s atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.	Ikigendajuru carungitswe mukirere hakoreshejwe iroketi. Abashakashatsi bakoresha indorerwamwo mukirere kubera umuyaga w'isi urakebanya igice c'umuco hamwe n'ibirabwa.
It takes a giant rocket over a 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope in space.	Bisaba ikiroketi kinini cane gisumba intambwe 100 mu burebure mu gushira ikigendajuru canke indorerwamwo mu kirere.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is given us much easier and faster transportation.	Ipine ryarahinduye isi muburyo budasanzwe. Ikintu kinini cane ipine ryadufashije ni ukworosha n'ukwihutisha iyunguruzwa ry'abantu n'ibintu.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other transportation devices.	Yatuzaniye itereni, imodoka, n'ibindi bikoresho vy'ukwunguruza ibintu n'abantu.
Under them are more medium sized cats that eat medium sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.	Haca hakurikira ibikoko vyo mu bwoko bw'inyabu bifise ubunini bugereranye birya ibikoko bigereranye kuva ku nkwavu gushika ku mpongo.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat the far more numerous small prey like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.	Ubwa nyuma, haza inyabu nyinshi ntonto (harimwo n'inyabu z'intungano ziyerereza) zirya ibinyabuzima vyinshi cane bitobito nk'udukoko tuguruka, utwo mu bwoko bw'imbeba, imiserebanyi n'inyoni.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special job each cat holds that keeps it from competing with others.	Igitima birama ni ukuba kimwe cose gifise ivyo cisangije, igikorwa ciharije gituma buri gikoko co mu bwoko bw'inyabu kidahiganwa n'ibindi.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.	Intambwe ni vyo bikoko vyo mu bwoko bw'inyabu bikunda cane kubana, zikaba zibana ari nyinshi mu bigwi.
Prides are made up of one to three related adult males, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.	Ivyo bigwi biba birimwo intambwe ikuze imwe gushika kuri zitatu z'ingabo zifise ico zipfana, hamwe n'ingore zishika kuri mirongitatu be n'ibibuguru vyazo.
The females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.	Ingore kenshi ziba zifise ubucuti bw'amaraso bwa cane, ari umuryango munini w'izivukana be n'ivyana vyazo vy'ibigore.
Lion prides act much like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.	Ibigwi vy'intambwe usanga vyigenza cane nk'ibigwi vy'amabingira canke vy'imbwa. Amabingira n'imbwa birafitaniye isano ritangaje n'intambwe mu nyifato (mugabo bigatandukana n'ibindi vyo mu bwoko bw'inyabu), kandi birica rwose ibikoko bihiga.
A well rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances and pull with five times the force of a strong human.	Ingwe ni igikoko kinonotse rwose, ikaba ishobora kwurira (naho atari cane), kwoga, gusimba ahantu harehare no gukwegesha ikintu n'inguvu ziruta incuro zitanu iz'umuntu akomeye.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.	Ingwe iri mu mugwi umwe (Genus Panthera) n'intambwe, ingwe yitwa, léopard, n'iyitwa, jaguar. Mu bikoko vyo mu bwoko bw'inyabu, ivyo bine ni vyo gusa biroha.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of snarly, shouted words.	Ukuroha kw'ingwe ntigukomeye nk'ukw'intambwe, ahubwo womengo ni ukuvuga amajambo itontoma yongera isemerera.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that the ocelot hunts are far smaller than it is.	Utugwe twitwa ocelots turakunda kurya udukoko dutoyi. Turacakira inkende, inzoka, udukoko two mu bwoko bw'imbeba n'inyoni iyo bishobotse. Ibikoko nka vyose utwo tugwe duhiga, usanga tubiruta ubunini.
Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing for where they've been on the ground.	Abahinga biyumvira ko utwo tugwe dukoreshea ukumoterwa mu (guhiga) ibikoko vyo kurya, tukagenda turimotereza hasi ngo tumenye aho vyaciye.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move very stealthily, too. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings then pouncing on their prey.	Amaso y'utwo tugwe twitwa ocelots arashobora kubona neza mu mwiza w'ijoro kandi turomboka cane. Mu guhiga ibikoko, utwo tugwe turabunda ahantu tukiyoberanya maze tukabisimbirako.
When a small group of living things (a small population) gets separated from the main population that they came from (like if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they can't easily move back) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.	Igihe umugwi mutoyi w'ibinyabuzima (ibinyabuzima bikeyi) utandukanijwe n'umugwi nyamukuru waturutsemwo (nk'iyo ivyo binyabuzima bijabutse imisozi canke uruzi, canke iyo vyimukiye kuri rindi zinga ku buryo bibigora gusubira inyuma), kenshi usanga biri ahantu hatandukanye n'aho vyahora.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what they had needed before.	Aho hantu hashasha, haba hari ibintu bitandukanye n'ivya hamwe ha hambere, hakaba n'ibindi binyabuzima vy'ibikeba. Ivyo binyabuzima bishasha bica bikenera ibihimba bishasha canke bihuje n'igihe kugira bishobore guhiganirwa neza ibintu bihari, kuruta uko vyari bikenewe kare.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.	Vya binyabuzima vyo mu ntango ntivyahindutse na gato kandi nta yandi mahinduka yo ku mubiri birakenera.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the other population.	Uko rero wa mugwi mushasha utanguye kumenyera ahantu hashasha, uca utangura kudasa na wa mugwi wundi.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can't be called the same species.	Amahero, inyuma y'imyaka ibihumbi canke amamiliyoni, iyo migwi ibiri isigara idasa ku buryo ata wovuga ko ari ubwoko bumwe.
We call this process speciation, which just means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.	Tuvyita ivuka ry'ubwoko. Ivuka ry'ubwoko ni ingaruka itobura gushika kandi riri mu bintu bihambaye cane bigize ihindagurika ry'ibinyabuzima.
Plants make oxygen which humans breathe, and they take in carbon-dioxide which humans exhale (that is, breathe out).	Ibimera birahingura umwuka wa ogisijeni dukwega mu guhema, na vyo bikakira umwuka witwa gaze karubonike (dusohora mu guhema).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.	Izuba rirafasha ibimera guhingura imfungurwa zavyo biciye ku co bita photosynthèse. Biratanga n'igitutu.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most foods that we eat are plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.	Ibimera turavyubakisha inzu, tukabikuramwo n'impuzu. Vyinshi mu vyo dufungura ni ibimera. Ata bimera, ibikoko vyohona.
Mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.	Mosasorusi yari inyamaswa ya mbere ikomeye mu gihe cayo, rero nta co yatinya, kiretse bigenzi vyayo.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.	Imibangabanga yayo miremire yariko amenyo arenga 70 asongoye nk’urwembe, hamwe n’ayandi atonze hejuru mu kanwa, bisigura ko ata kintu vyahurira mu nzira cashobora kurusimba.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.	Ntitubizi neza, mugabo irashobora kuba yari ifise ururimi rusatuye. Mu vyo yakunda kurya harimwo ibinyamasyo, ifi nini, hamwe n’izindi mosasorusi. Ishobora kuba yararya n'ibindi bikoko bisangiye ubwoko.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as T. rex would be no match for it.	Yaratera ikintu cose cinjiye mu mazi; n’idinozoro nini cane nka T. rex ntiyari kuyihanga.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, Romans did have their share of strange or unusual feast items, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse	Naho nyinshi mu mfungurwa z'Abaroma zari zimeze nk'izo dufungura, hari imfungurwa zitamenyerewe canke zidasanzwe zitari nke bafungura ku misi mikuru yabo. Twovuga nk'impebera, ibinyoni vyitwa paons, ibifyera n'imbeba yitwa loir.
Another difference was that while the poor people and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they would lounge on their sides while they ate their meals.	Irindi tandukaniro ni uko mu gihe abakene n'abagore bicara ku ntebe mu gufungura, abagabo b'abatunzi bobo bakunda gusangirira hamwe inzimano, bakaryamira urubavu mu gufungura.
Ancient Roman meals couldn't have included foods that came to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.	Mu vyo Abaroma ba kera bafungura, ntihashobora kuba harimwo imfungurwa zahavuye zishika i Buraya zivuye muri Amerika canke muri Aziya mu binjana vyo mu nyuma.
For instance, they didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.	Nk'akarorero, nta bigori, itomati, ibiraya canke kakawo bari bafise, kandi nta Muroma wa kera yigeze arya idendo.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the home of the god.	Abanyababiloni barubakira imwe yose mu mana zabo urusengero nyamukuru, bikitwa ko ari ho itaha.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to attend to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.	Abantu barashikanira izo mana, abaherezi na bo bakagerageza kwitaho ivyo izo mana zikeneye biciye ku birori n'imisi mikuru.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.	Urusengero rwose rwaba rufise ikigo ca bose hamwe n'ikibanza ceranda c'indani cinjiramwo abaherezi gusa.
Sometimes special pyramid shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be a part of the temples.	Zimwe muri izo nsengero wasanga zubatseko iminara yitwa ziggourats ifise imero ya piramide.
The top of the tower was special sanctuary for the god.	Hejuru kuri nya munara haba ari ikibanza ceranda gihariwe iyo mana.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.	Kubera ubushuhe bwo mu Karere k'Abarabu, inzu ntiyari ihambaye cane.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family happened in the open air.	Imiryango y'Abaheburayo yakorera ibintu vyinshi hanze.
Women did the cooking in the yard; stores were just open counters looking into the street. Stone was used for building houses.	Abagore batekera ku kigo. Amaduka yari amakontwari gusa arangaye araba kw'ibarabara. Inzu zubakishwa amabuye.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.	Kubera ko ata mashamba manini yari ahari mu gihugu ca Kanani, inkwi zari zizimvye rwose.
Greenland was settled sparsely. In the Norse sagas they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when travelling further west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.	Groenland yabamwo bake. Mu nkuru za kera z'Abanyasikandinaviya, bavuga ko Erik the Red yomowe muri Isilande ahowe ubwicanyi, aca agenda agana mu burengero, ashika i Groenland aca ahita ukwo.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.	Mugabo naho yahubuye, imiryango y'aba Eskimo yari isanzwe ibayo.
Though each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.	Naho Danemarike, Suwede, Noroveje na Isilande vyose vyitwa ko ari ibihugu vy'Abanyasikandinaviya, hari ibintu vyinshi vyatandukanya abanyagihugu baho, abami baho, imigenzo yabo na kahise kabo.
If you have watched the movie National Treasure, you may think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.	Nimba umaze kuraba isinema yitwa National Treasure, ushobora kwiyumvira ko hari ikarata y'ahanyegejwe itunga yanditswe inyuma y'urwandiko rw'Itangazo ry'ukwikukira.
However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.	Mugabo si vyo. Hari ivyanditswe inyuma y'urwo rwandiko, ariko si ikarata yerekana ahanyegeteje itunga.
"Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words ""Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776"". The text appears on the bottom of the document, upside down."	"Inyuma y'urwandiko rw'Itangazo ry'ukwikukira hari handitse amajambo avuga ngo ""Itangazo ry'ukwikukira ryanditswe ubwa mbere kw'igenekerezo rya 4 Mukakaro 1776"". Ayo majambo aboneka epfo kuri nya rwandiko, acuramye."
While no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.	Nta wuzi neza uwanditswe urwo rwandiko, mugabo ikizwi co ni uko mu ntango urushato runini ayo majambo yari yanditseko (rungana n'amapuse 29¾ kuri 24½) rwazingwa mu kurubika.
So, it is likely that the notation was added simply as a label.	Ayo majambo ashobora rero kuba yanditswe gusa kugira adondore urwo rwandiko.
The D-Day landings and the following battles had freed the north of France, but the south still wasn't free.	Uburaruko bw'Ubufaransa bwari bwakize umwansi kubera inteko zari zashitseyo maze hakaba intambara, mugabo ubumanuko bwari bukiri mu minwe y'umwansi.
"It was ruled by the ""Vichy"" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them."	"Hatwarwa n'Abafaransa bitirirwa ""Vichy"". Abo bari Abafaransa bagiranye amasezerano n'Abadagi mu 1940, bakaba bakorana n'abansi aho kubarwanya."
"On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called ""Operation Dragoon""."	"Ku bwa 15 Myandagaro 1940, urunani rw'inteko zishigikiye Ubufaransa zarateye ubumanuko bw'Ubufaransa. Ico gitero ciswe ""opération Dragoon""."
In just two weeks the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.	Mu ndwi zibiri gusa, Abanyamerika n'ingabo z'Ubufaransa zidegemvya bari bamaze gutabara ubumanuko bw'Ubufaransa, batanguye kwerekeza mu Budagi.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a significant large group of people who live and work co-operatively, a society.	Ico bita civilisation ni imico imwe iba isangiwe n'umugwi munini cane w'abantu babana basenyera ku mugozi umwe, ikibano.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and that also somehow defines the size of the society.	Iryo jambo civilisation riva kw'ijambo ry'ikilatini civilis risigura ngo c'abanyagihugu, rifitaniye isano n'irindi ry'ikilatini civis risobanura umwenegihugu, hamwe na civitas risigura igisagara canke igisagara-Reta, kandi ivyo hari ukuntu bitomora ingene ikibano kingana.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture implies the passing on of knowledge across several generations, a lingering cultural footprint and fair dissemination.	Ibisgara-leta ni vyo vyavyaye amahanga. Kugira ikibano kigumane imico bisaba ko ubumenyi bugenda burahanahanwa urunganwe ku rundi, iyo mico ikazigamwa kandi igakwiragizwa ku rugero rwiza.
Minor cultures often vanish without leaving relevant historic evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.	Kenshi imico mitomito irazimangana idasize n'ibintu bifadika vyo kuyibukirako, ku buryo idashobora kwitwa vy'ukuri civilisation.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with the Congress being its only component—under the Articles of Confederation.	Mu gihe c'Intambara y'ukwikukira, ya maleta 13 mu ntango yabanje gushinga leta rusangi hisuzwe Amategeko y'urunani. Yari leta idafise inguvu yari igizwe gusa n'Inama nshingamateka.
Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.	Inama nshingamateka nta bubasha yari ifise bwo gutegeka abantu gutanga amakori. Kubera ko ata rwego rw'ubutegetsi canke rw'ubutungane rwari ruhari ku rwego rw'igihugu, iyo Nama yaca yikora ku batware bo mu maleta atandukanye kugira bashire mu ngiro amategeko yose yashinze, ariko kenshi bakaba batabikora.
It also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.	Nta bubasha yari ifise bwo kurengera amategeko ajanye n'amakori be n'ibitigiri vy'amahera vyashinzwe mu maleta atandukanye.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.	Amategeko yabwirizwa kwemerwa n'amaleta yose imbere y'uko yemezwa kandi amaleta yarakengera leta rusangi ku buryo abayaserukira wasanga kenshi basivye.
Italy's national football, along with German national football team is the second most successful team in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.	Umugwi nserukiragihugu w'Ubutaliyano w'umupira w'amaguru, hamwe n'uw'Ubudagi, ni wo mugwi wa kabiri ukomeye kw'isi yose kandi ni wo watsindiye Igikombe c'isi yose ca ca FIFA mu 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.	Mu nkino zikundwa cane harimwo umupira w'amaguru, uw'amaboko, vole, umupira wo mu mazi, kurwanisha inkota, rigibi, isiganwa ry'amakinga, hoke yo ku bibarafu, hoke y'abakina bambaye ibirato vy'amapine, hamwe n'isiganwa F1 ry'amapikipiki.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.	Inkino zo mu rushana rukanye cane zikundwa cane mu mihingo yo mu buraruko, Abataliyano bakaba baja mu mahiganwa mpuzamakungu na Olempike.
Japans holds nearly 7,000 islands (the biggest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!	Ubuyapani bugizwe n'amazinga hafi 7.000 (rinini akaba ari Honshu), bigatuma buba izinga rigira 7 kw'isi yose mu bunini!
"Due to the cluster/group of islands Japan has, Japan is often referred to, on a geographical stance, as an ""archipelago"""	"Kubera umugwi w'amazinga agize Ubuyapani, bukunze kwitwa mu bijanye n'indondabihugu ""urunani rw'amazinga""."
Taiwan beginning start way back in 15th century where European sailors passing by record the island’s name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.	Kahise ka Tayiwani gatangura mu kinjana ca 15 igihe Abanyaburaya bahaca bari mu mato bahakita Ilha Formosa, ni ukuvuga izina ry'akaroruhore.
In 1624,Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.	Mu 1624, Ishirahamwe ry'Abanyaholande riraba ivyo mu Buhindi bwo mu Buseruko ryarashize icicaro mu bumanuko bushira uburengero bwa Tayiwani. Ryarahinduye ukuntu abanyagihgu baho barima ibinyantete, rikoresha n'abakozi b'Abashinwa mu mirima yaryo y'umuceri n'iy'imisigati.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces take control of Taiwan’s western and northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.	Mu 1683, ingabo z'abami bo mu muryango wa Qing (1644-1912) zarafashe intara zo mu burengero no mu buraruko bwa Tayiwani zegereye amazi, zica zita Tayiwani akarere kegukira Ubwami bwa Qing mu 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it cedes sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which rules the island until 1945.	Mu 1895, intwaro ya Qing imaze kuneshwa mu Ntambara ya mbere y'Abashinwa n'Abayapani (1894-1895), yaciye isinya Amasezerano y'i Shimonoseki, yegurira Ubuyapani izinga rya Tayiwani, burahaganza gushika mu 1945.
Machu Picchu consist of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.	Ico kibanza Machu Picchu kigizwe n'inyubako zitatu nyamukuru: Intihuatana, Urusengero rw'izuba, n'ahitwa Icumba c'amadirisha atatu.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.	Nyinshi mu nyubakwa ziri hafi yaho zarasubiwemwo kubira ngo ingenzi zishobore kubona ingene zasa aho hambere.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues till today.	Mu 1976, ibice mirongo itatu kw'ijana ry'ico kibanza Machu Picchu vyari bimaze gusubirwamwo, n'ubu bakiriko.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the close of the analog film era.	Nk'akarorero, amafoto menshi kw'isi usanga areha na mm 35, ikaba ari yo ngero ya filime yakoreshwa cane mu mpera z'ikiringo c'amafoto akoresha filime.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.	Ayo mafoto aracahindurwa. N'igihambaye kuruta, ingero zayo zirakoreshwa n'utwuma dukwega umuco two mu vyuma bifotora vya none.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm in width by 24mm in height.	Mu vy'ukuri, kandi hari ukuntu bitangaje, filime za mm35 usanga zifise mm36 z'ubwaguke na mm 24 z'amahagarara.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole-number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.	Rero ingero z'amafoto aja kuri izo filime (ukaba uronka ibitigiri vyuzuye mu kugabura na cumi na kabiri) bivugwa ko ari 3:2.
Many common formats (APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or closely approximate this aspect ratio.	Ingero nyinshi zimenyerewe (izitwa APS, nk'akarorero) usanga zingana n'izo zindi canke zigomba kungana.
The much-abused and often-ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline creating dynamism while keeping a measure of order in an image.	Rya tegeko rikoreshwa birenze kandi rikunda gutorwa amahinyu ryitwa règle des tiers ni uburyo bworoshe bwo gutuma ishusho ikabura kandi ibiyigize bikaba bipanze neza.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).	Iryo tegeko rivuga ko ahantu heza hoja ikintu nyamukuru co kuri iyo shusho ari ku mahuriro y'imirongo ishinze n'iyikitse igabura nya shusho mu twumba dutatudutatu tugerekeranye (raba akarorero).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.	Muri ico gihe ca kahise k'Uburayi, ishengero rya Gatolika, rimaze gutunga no kugira ububasha, ryaragizweko amatohoza.
For over a thousand years the Christian religion had bound European states together despite differences in language and customs. I	Mu kiringo kirenga imyaka igihumbi, idini rya Gikirisu ryaratumye ibihugu vya Buraya vyunga ubumwe naho bitari bisangiye ururimi n’imico.
Its all-pervading power affected everyone from king to commoner.	Uburongozi bwayo bukwiye hose bwagira ingaruka kuri bose, kuva ku mwami gushika ku muntu asanzwe.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church are there specifically for that reason.	Imwe mu ngingo ngenderwako z'abakirisu ivuga ko itunga rikwiye gukoreshwa mu kugabanya umubabaro n’ubukene kandi ko ibigega vy’amafaranga y’ishengero bihari canecane kubera iyo mvo.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this tenet was being met.	Uburongozi bukuru bw'ishengero bwari i Roma imyaka irenga igihumbi kandi uku guhuriza hamwe uburongozi n'ubutunzi vyatumye abantu benshi bibaza nimba iyi ngingo ngenderwako yariko irakurikizwa.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.	Imishamirano itanguye, Ubwongereza bwaciye bufatira ibihano Ubudagi mu vy'amato.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.	Uwo mukenyuro warakunze kuko watumye abasoda babo n'abanyagihugu bataronka ibintu vya nkenerwa, naho ivyo bihano vyari biteye kubiri n'amategeko mpuzamakungu yemewe na benshi yanditswe biciye ku masezerano mpuzamakungu atari make yari yabaye mu binjana biri vyari biheze.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships.	Ubwongereza bwarateze imitego mu mazi mpuzamakungu kugira ntihagire amato yinjira mu bice kanaka binini vy'ibahari, bituma n'ibihugu bitari mu ntambara bigeramirwa.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.	Kubera ko ata vyinshi uwo mukenyuro wavuzweko, Ubudagi bwari bwiteze ko vyogenze ukwo nyene ku kuntu bwarenza urugero mu kurwanisha amato aca munsi y'amazi.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.	Mu myaka ya 1920, ibihugu vyinshi n'abenegihugu benshi bashima kwirinda intambara no kwirabira ivyabo.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.	Kubera ko ibihugu vyinshi vyari vyabonye amabi n'amarushwa n'Intambara ya mbere y'isi yose, vyipfuza kwirinda kuzobisubiramwo.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.	Mu 1884, Tesla yarimukiye muri Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika agiye gukora mw'ishirahamwe Edison Company i New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.	Yashitse muri Amerika afise amahera angana n'uduce 4 tw'idolari rimwe, igitabu c'ivyese n'ikete rimurata yahawe na Charles Batchelor (yahora amukoresha) ryo guha Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinctive dynasty.	Ubushinwa bwa kera bwari bufise uburyo bwisangije bwo kwerekena ibihe bitandukanye. Ikiringo cose bwaciyemwo canke umuryago wose waciye ku butegetsi vyari bihuye n'umuryango kanaka wa cami.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces. The best-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms epoch taking place for 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasty.	Vyongeye, hagati y'umuryango wa cami n'uwundi hagiye haracamwo uruhagarara kubera ukwigabagura kw'intara. Ikiringo kizwi cane muri ivyo biringo ni iciswe ic'Ubwami butatu camaze imyaka 60 hagati y'umuryango wa cami wa Han n'uwa Jin.
During these periods fierce warfare took place between many nobles fighting for the throne.	Muri ivyo bihe harabaye intambara zikaze hagati y'abakuru benshi baniganira ubutegetsi.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in Ancient China’s history thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace at Xi’an.	Ico kiringo c'Ubwami butatu ni kimwe mu vyasesetsemwo amaraso menshi cane muri kahise k'Ubushinwa bwa kera. Abantu ibihumbi n'ibihumbi barapfuye bariko barwanira intebe y'ubwami iruta izindi zose ku kirimba gihambaye c'i Xi’an.
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief the country belongs to the people not to one sole ruler.	Iyo migumuko yaragize ingaruka mu vy'ikibano no mu vya politike nko gukoresha ingero bita système métrique, kuva mu ntwaro z'agahotoro bakaja mu ntwaro ya republika, gukunda igihugu no kubona ko igihugu ari ic'abanyagihugu atari ic'umutegetsi umwe.
Also after the Revolution occupations were open to all male applicants allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.	Inyuma y'iyo migumuko yabaye mu Bufaransa, abantu bose b'igitsina-gabo baremerewe gushikira imirimo batashikira, bigatuma abafise ishaka n'ubutwari baroranirwa.
Same goes for the military because instead of army rankings being based on class they were now based on cailaber.	No mu gisoda ni ukwo vyagenze kuko bari basigaye bashobora kuronka amapete hisunzwe ubutwari aho gufatira ku miryango bavamwo.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working class people of other country's to began their own revolutions.	Iyo migumuko yo mu Bufaransa yatumye n'abanyagihugu batobato benshi bafashwe nabi bo mu bindi bihugu batangura kugumuka.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as “Hira‘” on the Mountain of “Noor” (light) for contemplation.	Muhamadi yarazirikana cane ibintu birengeye ivyo ng'aha kw'isi. Yarakunda kuja mw'isenga ryahavuye ryitwa “Hira‘” ku Musozi wa “Noor” (umuco) agiye kuzirikana.
he cave itself, which survived the times, gives a very vivid image of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.	Iryo senga riracariho kandi uriravye urabona neza ko Muhamadi yakunda kuzirikana ivy'Imana.
Resting on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.	Iryo senga riri kw'isonga ry'umwe mu misozi yo mu buraruko bwa Maka, rikaba riri ahantu hiherereye cane, hadashikwa.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all even if one knew it existed. Once inside the cave, it is a total isolation.	Mu bisanzwe, iryo senga riragoye gutora naho uba uzi ko ribaho. Umaze kuryinjiramwo, ntusubira kumenya ivyo hanze.
Nothing can be seen other than the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.	Nta kindi ubona atari ijuru rikeye, ryiza riri hejuru n'imisozi myinshi ihakikuje. Uri muri iryo senga, ibintu vyo muri iyi si ubona canke wumva ni bike cane.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing today.	Piramide Ikomeye y'i Giza ni kimwe mu bintu indwi vy'agatangaza vyo kw'isi bikiriho.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor dead Pharaoh.	Iyo Piramide Ihambaye yubatswe n'Abanyamisiri mu kinjana ca gatatu M.K., ikaba ari imwe mu mapiramide manini yubatswe ku bwo gutera iteka Abafarawo bapfuye.
"The Giza Plateau, or ""Giza Necropolis"" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx."	"Itaba ry'i Giza, iryitwa kandi ""Giza Necropolis"", riri mu Kiyaya c'Abapfuye mu Misiri kirimwo amapiramide atari make (nini muri yo ikaba ari ya piramide ihambaye), imva ntonto zitari nke, insengero zitari nke na ca gishusho kinini citwa Sphinx."
The great pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.	Piramide ihambaye yubatswe ku bwo gutera iteka Farawo Khufu, izindi piramide ntonto nyinshi, imva n'insengero na vyo vyubakwa ku bwo gutera iteka abagore ba Khufu n'incuti ziwe.
"The ""up bow"" mark looks like a V and the ""down bow mark"" like a staple or a square missing its bottom side."	"Akamenyetso kitwa ""hejuru ku muheto"" gasa n'urudome V, akitwa ""hepfo ku muheto"" kagasa n'akuma gafatanya impapuro canke agakiramende kabuze umurongo w'epfo."
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.	Ako kitwa hejuru gasigura ko mu kuvuza ushirako isonga ry'umuheto ugaca uja imbere, akitwa hepfo kagasigura ko uhera epfo ku muheto (aho ukuboko gufatiye umuheto) ugaca uvuza ukwega.
An up-bow usually generates a softer sound, while a down-bow is stronger and more assertive.	Kuvuza uduza kenshi bitanga akajwi koroshe, gukwega bigasohora ijwi rikomeye ry'inguvu.
Feel free to pencil in your own marks, but remember the printed bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.	Ntiwitinye kwishirirako utumenyetso n'ikaramu y'igiti, mugabo wibuke ko utumenyetso tujanye n'umuheto dusanzwe turiko dufise insobanuro mu muziki, tukaba rero dukwiye kwubahirizwa.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette their two young children (11 year old Marie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, on the 6th October 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.	Abari batekewe n'ubwoba Umwami Louis wa XVI, Umwamikazi Mariya Antoinette n'abana babo babiri (Mariya Tereza w'imyaka 11 na Louis-Charles w'imyaka ine) na mushiki w'umwami, umupfasoni Elizabeti, kw'igenekerezo rya 6 ya Gitugutu mu 1789 bahatiwe gusubira i Paris bavuye i Versailles n'igitero c'abagore bo mw'isoko.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a mob of people screaming and shouting threats against the King and Queen.	Mu ngendeshwa, bajabutse basubira i Paris bakikujwe n'igitero c'abantu bakoma induru bagira n'iterabwoba ku Mwami n'Umwamikazi.
The mob of people forced the King And Queen to have their carriage windows wide open.	Ico gitero c'abantu categetse Umwami n'Umwamikazi kurangaza imiryango y'ingendeshwa barimwo.
At one point a member of the mob waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.	Harageze aho umwe mu bagize ico gitero yazungurukanye umutwe w'umwe mu barinzi b'i bwami yiciwe i Versailles imbere y'Umwamikazi yatekewe n'ubwoba.
The war expenditures of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.	Amafaranga y'intambara y'intwaro ya kavamahanga ya Amerika mu kwigarurira Filipine yarishwe n'abanya Filipine bo nyene ubwabo.
They were compelled to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to defray a major part of the expenditures and the interest on bonds floated in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.	Bahatiwe gutanga amatagisi ku ntwaro ya gikoroni y'Amerika kugira barihe igihande kinini c'ayo mafaranga kandi inyungu ku mari za Leta zaratanzwe mu mazu y'amabanki yo muri Wall Street kw'izina rya Leta ya Filipine.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the protracted exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.	Ego nyene, izo nyungu z'umurengera zivuye mu kununuza kw'igihe kirekire abanyagihugu ba Filipine nikwo kwabaye ishingiro ry'inyungu z'intwaro y'amahanga ya Amerika.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.	Kugira utahure izo aba Templiers, umuntu ategerezwa gutahura imvo zatumye uwo muhari ubaho.
The age where the events took place is commonly referred as the High Middle Ages the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).	Igihe ivyo bintu vyabereyeko benshi bahita ngo ni muri Haut moyen-âge igihe ca kahise ka Buraya mu binjana vya 11, 12, na 13 (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.	Iyo Haut moyen-âge yari yatanguriwe na moyen âge ya kare yakurikiwe na moyen âge yo mu mpera, iyo nayo bigahurizwako ko yaheze mu myaka ya 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology-push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.	Ubuhinga mpindurabuzima ni ijambo ririmwo ivyiyumviro vyinshi mu vy’ukuri, kuva ku ciyumviro c’uko ubuhinga buzana ibikoresho bishasha canke c’uko ubuhinga dutegerezwa kubwemera, gushika mbere no ku ciyumviro c'uko kazoza k’umuntu kavana n'ivyiyumviro vy'ishimikiro birashe bifitaniye isano n’amategeko y’ubuhinga, ano akaba aheza akisungwa mu guhingura ibikoresho vy'ubuhinga bwa none.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ""effects"" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned."	"Insiguro nyinshi z'ijambo ubuhinga mpindurabuzima zihurira ku vyiyumviro rusangi bibiri: ko iterambere ry’ubuhinga ubwaryo rica mu nzira irengeye cane ivy'imico kama n'ivya politike, kandi ko ubuhinga na bwo bugira ingaruka ""ingaruka"" ndemanwa ku kibano c'abantu, atari izivuye bitandukanye biba mu kibano."
For example, one might say that the motor car necessarily leads to the development of roads.	Nk’akarorero, umuntu yoshobora kuvuga ko umuduga utuma hategerezwa kubaho iterambere ry’amabarabara.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.	Ariko, umugwi w’amabarabara ari mu gihugu nta nyungu mu vy’ubutunzi uzana iyo igitigiri c’imiduga ari gito cane. Ni co gituma ubundi buryo bwo guhingura burashirwaho mu ntumbero yo kugabanya amahera ugutunga umuduga bitwara.
Mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.	Kuba abantu benshi batunze imiduga bigira kandi ingaruka nini ku masanganya yo mu mabarabara, bigatuma hatorwa ubuhinga bushasha mu gisata c’amagara y’abantu bwo kuvura imibiri yononekaye.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.	Romantisisme yari ifise uruhande runini rw'ihindurabuzima rishingiye ku muco, rwakuwe ku banditsi nka Goethe, Fichte na Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the geography molded individuals, and over time customs and culture related to that geography arose, and these, being in harmony with the place of the society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.	Mu vya Romanticisme, akarere karahinduye abantu, uko igihe cagiye kirahera imigenzo n'umuco ifatiye ku karere vyaribonekeje, kandi ivyo, kuko vyari bifitanye amahoro n'akarere k'ikibano, vyari vyiza kurusha amategeko y'agahato y'ikibiriraho.
In the manner that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.	Nkuko Pari izwi nk’umurwa mukuru w’imideri mu gihe ca none, ni ko Konsitantinople yafatwa nk’umurwa mukuru w’imideri mu gihe c’intwaro z'i Buraya zishingiye ku guha amatongo abanyagihugu kugira na bo bakorere bene kuyabaha.
Its renown for being an epicenter of luxury began in about 400 A.D. and lasted up until about 1100 A.D.	Ukumenyekana kwaho nk’ikibanza c’ihuriro ry'ibintu vy’agaciro kwatanguye nko mu mwaka wa 400 inyuma y’ivuka rya Yezu Kirisu gushika nko mu 1100 inyuma y'ivuka rya Yezu Kirisu.
Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that Crusaders had returned bearing gifts such as silks and spices that were valued more than what Byzantine markets offered.	Hatanguye gutakaza agaciro mu kinjana ca cumi na kabiri bivanye ahanini n'uko abarwanyi b'abakirisu bagarutse bafise ingabano harimwo ubusage n’ibirungo vyari bifise agaciro gasumba ak’ivyo kw’isoko yo mu nganji y'aba Byzantin.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.	Ni muri ico gihe nyene izina ry'umurwa mukuru w’imideri ryakuwe kuri Konsitantinople rica rihabwa Pari.
Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.	Uburyo bwa Goth bwashitse kure mu gihe co hagati y'ibinjana vya 10 - 11 n'ikinjana ca 14.
At the beginning dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.	Mu ntango imyambaro yisunga na cane cane umuco w'abanya Byzantin wo mu Buseruko.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west could lag behind by 25 to 30 year.	N'aho biri ukwo, bitewe n'inzira zo guhanahana amakuru zikwega, uburyo bwo mu burengerazuba bwarashobora gusigara inyuma imyaka nka 25 canke 30.
towards the end of the Middle Ages western Europe began to develop their own style. one of the biggest developments of the time as a result of the crusades people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.	mu mpera za Money-age uburaya bwo mu burengerazuba bwatanguye guteza imbere uburyo bwabo. Rimwe mw'iterambere ryo muri ico gihe ryaje nk'ingaruka y'intambara z'amadini abantu batanguye gukoresha ibifungo mu gufunga impuzu.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture carried out for the production of enough food to meet just the needs of the agriculturalist and his/her family.	Uburimyi bubayabaye ni uburimyi bukorwa kugira haboneke ivyo kurya bikwiye kugira bihaze neza na neza ivyipfuzo vy'umurimyi n'umuryango wiwe.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using saved seed native to the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.	Uburimyi bubayabaye ni sisiteme isanzwe kenshi iba itanagoye yo gukoresha intete wabitse ziva muri ako karere ugakoresha n'uguhinduranya ibiterwa canke n'ubundi buhinga busanzwe nk'ukwo kugira ugwize umwimbu.
Historically most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations.	Muri kahise abarimyi benshi barakora uburimyi bubayabaye kandi uku niko bikimeze mu bihugu vyinshi bikiri mu nzira y'amajambere.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.	Imico ya bake ihuriza hamwe abantu biyumvira kumwe bumva umengo ntibitaweho n'ikibano ikababafasha kwiyumva ko bafise aho bakukira.
Subcultures can be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.	Imigwi y'imico ya bake ishobora kuba itandukanye kubera imyaka. ubwoko, urugero, ikibanza na/canke igitsina c'abayigize.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.	Ibimenyetso biranga umugwi w'imico ya bake nk'aho utandukanye bishobora kuba ivy'ururimi, idini, igitsina. ikibanza canke imvo ziterateranye.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and argot.	Abantu bagize umugwi w'imico ya bake kenshi barerekana ubunyamuhari bwabo biciye ku gukoresha ibimenyetso mu buryo butandukanye, harimwo imyambaro, ukwo bitwara n'ururimi bisangije.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw upon the few unfortunate cases of children who were, through neglect, misfortune, or wilful abuse, not socialized by adults while they were growing up.	Bumwe bu buryo bukoreshwa cane mu kwerekana akamaro k'umubano mwiza ni ukurabira kuri tumwe mu turorero tutagenze neza kw'abana, biciye mu kutitabwaho, amahirwe make canke uguhohoterwa nkana, batigishijwe kubana neza n'abakuze igihe bari bagikura.
"Such children are called ""feral"" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases this child abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairment."	"Abo bana babita ""abatimbayi"" canke inayamaswa. Bamwe mu bana b'abatimbayi barugaranwe n'abantu (kenshi na kenshi abavyeyi babo); mu turorero tumwe tumwe uku gutabwa kwaterwa n'uko abavyeyi banka ubumuga bukaze bw'umwana bwo mu mutwe canke bwo ku mubiri."
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.	Abana b'abatimbayi bashobora kuba barakorewe ihohoterwa rikomeye ry'abana canke uguhahamuka imbere yo gutabwa canke guhunga.
Others are alleged to have been brought up by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.	Abandi bivugwa ko baba barezwe n'ibikoko; abandi bakavugwa ko babaye mu mashamba ubwabo.
When completely brought up by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely like those of the particular care-animal, such as its fear of or indifference to humans.	Mu gihe barezwe cane n'ibikoko batari abantu, abana b'abatimbayi berekana imyigenzo (mu vy'umubiri) ihakwa kumera cane nk'iyico gikoko cabareze, nk'ubwoba canke ukutanerwa abantu.
While project based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step beyond.	Mu gihe kwiga ufatiye ku migambi vyategerezwa gutuma ukwiga vyoroha kandi bikaryoha, ugufasha abanyeshure bishikana ku ntambwe yo hejuru.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning but rather an aid that provides support to individuals whom are undergoing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or beginning a new project.	Mu gihe kwiga ufatiye ku migambi vyategerezwa gutuma ukwiga vyoroha kandi bikaryoha, ugufasha abanyeshure bishikana ku ntambwe yo hejuru.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.	Ivyo gufashisha abanyeshure bishobora kuba bitaboneka canke biboneka, mu yandi majambo, umwigisha ni nk'akarorero nk'igikoresho, co kimwe na karya kuma gafatanya impapuro ko muri Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are internalized in the software and are meant to question, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been to challenging for the student to handle alone.	Ivyifashisho bitaboneka biba biri indani muri porogaramu yo ku nyabwonko kandi biba bigenewe kubaza, gutanguza canke gusigura intambwe zoba zabaye izigoranye cane kwikorana ku munyeshure.
Children are placed in Foster Care for a wide variety of reasons that range from neglect, to abuse, and even to extortion.	Abana bashirwa mu bigo bibitaho vyabigenewe kubera imvo zitandukanye ziva ku kutitabwaho, ku guhohoterwa gushika ndetse no ku guterwa ubwoba.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.	Nta mwana yategerezwa na rimwe gukurira ahantu batamurera neza, batamwitaho, canke batamuha indero, ariko biracaba.
We perceive the Foster Care System to be a safety zone for these children.	Tubona ko sisiteme y'ibigo vyitaho abana ko ariho hari umutekano kuri abo bana.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.	Sisiteme yacu y'ibigo vyitaho abana yitezwe kubaha aho baba hari umutekano, ababitaho babakunda, indero irashe, n'ukwitaho amagara neza.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home they were previously taken from.	Ikigo citaho abana citezwe kubaha ivyangombwa vyose vyari bibuze mu mazu baje bakuwemwo.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.	Ubuhinga ngurukanabumenyi bukoreshwa haba mu gutanga amakuru ku bantu benshi canke hagati y’abantu babiri.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and gratifications approach.	Ibintu bidasanzwe biranga ubuhinga ngurukanabumenyi bituma haboneka iyindi mice mfatirwako mu bijanye n'ubuhinga bwo kwihweza ingene abantu bakoresha ibimenyeshamakuru n'ico bumva bibamariye.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).	Nk'arorero; “kwiga” no “kuganira n'abandi” biratangwa nk'inkabuzo nyamukuru zimtuma hakoreshwa ubuhinga ngurukanabumenyi (James n'abandi, 1995).
“Personal involvement” and “continuing relationships” were also identified as new motivation aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.	“Kugira ikibanza bwite” no “kugira imigenderanire iramba” navyone vyarerekanwe nk'inkabuzo nshasha bikozwe na Eighmey na McCord (1998) aho bakora amatohozo ku kuntu abantu bakira imbuga.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements which last a few milliseconds.	Ugukoresha ivyo gufata amasanamu vyadushikanye ku gutora ubuhinda bukomeye mu kuntu duterega ibivuzwe akanya gato, uko mu maso hagaragara mu gihe c'akanya isase.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.	Na cane cane, biravugwa ko umuntu ashobora kumenya nimba umuntu ariko arabesha mu gutahura neza ibivuzwe gake.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately.	Oliver Sacks, mu rwandiko rwe Ijambo ry'Umukuru w'Igihugu, yerekanye ukuntu abantu badashoboye gutahura ibivugwa kubera iyononekara ry'ubwonko baguma n'ubundi bashobora kumenya neza imvugakuri.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.	Aranavuga ahubwo ko ubwo bushobozi bwo gutahura imyigenzo y'abantu bushobora kuba buri no mu bikoko nk'imbwa z'intungano.
Twentieth century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.	Ubushakashatsi bwo mu kinjana ca mirongo ibiri bwerekanye ko hariho imigwi ibiri itandukanye ya karemano: iyinyegeje n'iyishirwa ahabona.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.	Ihindagurika ryongeyeko karemano nshasha, hama icagurwa riyrikuramwo mu mugwi wa karemano ziboneka.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.	Ikumira n'ugufatanganya bituma haba ihindagurika imbere n'inyuma hagati y'imigwi ibiri muri buri runganwe.
Out on the savanna, it is hard for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino-acid requirements from available plant resources.	Mw'ishamba rya savane, biragoye ko inkende ifise ivyo mu nda bisa nk'ibi vy'abantu yohaza ivyunyunyu ikenera biturutse ku biterwa biba bihari.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.	Kandi uretse n'ivyo, kunanirwa gukwiza ivyo bifise ingaruka mbi zikomeye: gukurana akabonge, gufungura nabi, kandi mu maherezo n'urupfu.
The most readily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins accessible in leaves and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.	Ingaburo z'ibiterwa zikunze kuboneka zobaye ari indemamubiri zisangwa mu mababi no mu mboga, ariko ivyo biragora umubiri nk'uwa twebwe inkende ko wobisya kiretse bitetse.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) not only are easily digestible, but they provide high-quantity proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.	Ugereranije, ibifungurwa vy'ibikoko (ubunyegeri, imigina, amagi) ntivyoroshe gusa ku mubiri gusya, ahubwo bitanga indemamubiri zirimwo kandi n'ivyunyunyu vyose vya nkenerwa.
"All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their ""protein problem"" in somewhat the same way that chimps on the savanna do today."	"Rero ufatiye ku bintu vyose, ntitwotangara nima abakurambere bacu batoreye umuti ""ikibazo cabo c'indemamubiri"" mu buryo bugomba kumera nk'ubwo inkende zikoresha mw'ishamba rya savane uno musi."
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully awakening during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10–60 minutes).	Gukangagurika ni harya uvyuka wabitegekanije mu gihe uba uryamye bisanzwe hama ugasubira gusinzina haheze akanya gato (iminota 10-60).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you.	Ibi bishobora gukorwa hakoreshejwe ikengeri imeze nk'iyivuga bukebuke kugira imere nk'iyigukangura ariko itarinze kukuvyura.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.	Ni wisanga uriko urahindagura ikengeri mu gihe waryamye, ushobora kuyitereka ku rundi ruhande rw'icumba, kugira bigusabe kuvyuka mu kuyizimya.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking lots of fluid (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) prior to sleep, forcing one to get up to urinate.	Izindi nzira zisunga ibihimba zisaba kunwa cane (na cane cane amazi canke icayi, ibizwi kuyungurura umukoyo) imbere yo kuryama, bigatuma uvyuka kugira uje gusoba.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates oppositely to the amount of tension in one’s body and spirit.	Urugero rw'amahoro yo ku mutima umuntu afise rurafitaniye isano rihushanye n'urugero rw'imivurugano ibera mu mubiri no mu mushaha wiwe.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.	Ukwo iyo mivurugano aba ari mike, ni nakwo inguvu z'ubuzima bwa kubu ziba nyinshi. Buri muntu afise ubushobozi bwo kuronka amahoro n'umunezero bidacangiwe.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.	Buri muntu arashobora kuronka ukubonekerwa. Ikintu kimwe gusa kizibiye inzira zo gushika kuri iki cipfuzo ni imivurugano iturimwo n'ukubona ibintu nabi.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but were extended by the mahayana path of love and by a lot of techniques from Indian Yoga.	Ivy'aba Bouddha bo muri Tibet bishingiye ku nyigisho za Buddha, ariko vyakwiragijwe n'inzira yitwa iya mahayana y'urukundo n'ubundi buhinga bwinshi bwo muri Yoga y'Abahindi.
In principle the Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.	Mu mategeko y'aba Bouddha yo muri Tibet iroroshe cane. Igizwe na Yoga ya Kundalini, ugutekana ukiyumwira n'inzira y'urukundo rwemera vyose.
With Kundalini Yoga the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.	Na Yoga ya Kundalini inkomezi za Kundalini (inkomezi zo kubonekerwa) ziravyuka biciye mu nyifato za yoga, imyimenyerezo yo guhema, ama mantras hamwe n'amashusho.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the enlightenment consciousness is created.	Ihuriro ry'ibikorwa vyo kwicara ukiyumwira ryo muri Tibet ni Ikigirwamana ca Yoga. Biciye mu mashusho afasha kubonera mu vyiyumviro ibigirwamana bitandukanye aho inguvu zibonekera haruguruka, ivyitwa chakra bikuguruka hama ukubonekerwa kukabaho.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, leading to cooperation between the USSR and USA. With the end of the war the clashes of system, process and culture led to the countries falling out.	Ubudagi wari we mwansi wa bose mu ntambara ya 2 y'isi yose, bituma haba ugukorana hagati y'Uburusiya na Amerika. Mu mpera z'intambara isambuka ry'inzego, uko ibintu bikorwa hamwe n'umuco vyashikanye ibihugu ku ruhombo.
With two years of the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.	Mu myaka ibiri intambara imaze guhera, abahoze ari abashize hamwe bari bamaze kuba abansi hama intambara y'Ubutita yaratanguye.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought for real, by proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.	Yari igiye kumara imyaka 40 yakwirikiye kandi yari igiye kugwanwa vya nyavyo, n'ingabo z'inserukizi, ku bibuga vy'intambara muri Afirika na Aziya, muri Afuganistani, muri Cuba n'ibindi bibanza vyinshi.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganise along the Romanian bridgehead.	Gushika kw’igenenekerezo rya 17 Nyakanga 1939, ingabo z’igihugu ca Polonye zari zamaze gutsindwa, kandi icizere bari basigaranye cari icuko basubira gutunganya neza ibijanye no gutera ingabo za Rumaniya.
However, these plans were rendered obsolete nearly overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet's Union Red Army entered and created the Belarussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.	Ariko, iyo migambi ntaco yamaze igihe abasoda barenga 800.000 bo mu ngabo zitukura z’Abasoviyeti binjira, bagaca bashinga imipaka ya Biyelorusiya na Ukraine, inyuma yo gutera uturere two mu buseruko bwa Polonye mu buryo butandukanye n’amasezerano y’amahoro ya Riga. Ayo masezerano yari ayo kudatera ibitero hagati y’Abasoviyeti na Polonye hamwe n’ayandi masezerano mpuzamakungu bari giraniranye.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across oceans.	Gukoresha ubwato mu gutwara ibidandazwa nibwo buryo bwiza cane bwo gutwara abantu n’ibintu vyinshi mu kiyaga.
The job of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time, interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.	Akazi k’ubwato ni ako kuraba ko igihugu canyu gifise ububasha bwo gutwara abantu n’ibintu, kandi unaraba n’umwansi wawe ububasha afise mu gutwara abantu n’ibintu.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of WWII. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.	Akarorero keza ni mu ngwano ya kabiri y’isi mu kiyaga Atrantike. Abanyamerika batwara abasoda n’ibikoresho vyabo bakoresheje ikiyaga Atrantike kugira ngo bafashe Ubwongereza.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.	Muri ico gihe, Ubudage nabwo bwariko buragerageza guhagarika ivyariko biba bukoresheje ubwato bwibira.
Had the Allies failed, Germany probably would have been able to conquer Britain as it had the rest of Europe.	Iyaba Ubwongereza, Amerika, n'Ubumwe bw'Abasoviyeti barananiwe, Ubudage bwari gutsinda u Bwongereza nk’uko bwari bwabigize mu bindi bice vy’uburayi.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated roughly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.	Biboneka ko haheze imyaka 10,000 impene za mbere zitanguye kwororwa, mu misozi ya Zagros muri Irani.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.	Abantu ba kera batanguye kuzitunga kugira ngo baronke vyoroshe amata, ubwoya, inyama n’inkoba.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goatherds who were frequently children or adolescents, similar to the more widely known shepherd. These methods of herding are still used today.	Mu bisanzwe, impene zashirwa mu bundi busho bw’ibitungwa hanyuma zigashigwa mu misozi, ahari ubwatsi butotahaye. Kenshi zaragirwa n’abana kandi no muri ino minsi, ubwo buryo bwo kuzitunga buracariho.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th Century.	Ubwongereza nibwo bwubatse imikogote mu kinjana ca 16.
Although wagonways merely consisted of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly more rough roads of the day.	Naho inzira y’imikogote yari igizwe n’imbaho ​​zibangikanije gusa, amafarasi yayikwega yaranyaruka kandi agakwega n’imizigo myinshi kuruta amabarabara asanzwe.
Crossties were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realised that tracks would be more efficient if they had a stip of iron on the top.	Inzira z’imikogote zatangujwe kera kugirango ziyifate neza. Mu nyuma zaho niho habonetse ko vyoba vyiza bashizemwo icuma hejuru.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.	Ibi vyaciye bimenyerwa cane, ariko ico cuma caciye gituma amapine y’imikogote bayashirako ibindi bintu.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first full-iron rails were introduced.	Mu nyuma, amapine y’ibiti yarasubirijwe n’amapine y’ivyuma. Mu 1767, aca aratangura gukora.
The first known transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).	Ukwiyunguruza kwa mbere kuzwi kwari ugutambuka. Haraheze imyaka irenga imiliyoni zibiri abantu batanguye kugenda bahagaze kuva havutse Homo Erectus (bisigura umuntu ahagaze).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus did not walk upright as habitually.	Abantu bambere batanguye, abitwa Australopithecus, ntibahagarara neza.
Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.	Ugutambuka ku maguru abiri vyarabonetse ku bantu ba Australopithecus haheze imyaka miriyoni 4.2-3.9, naho abantu ba Sahelanthropus bashobora kuba baratambutse bakoresheje amaguru abiri nko mu myaka miriyoni indwi iheze.
We can start living more friendly to the environment, we can join to the environmental movement, and we can even be activists in order to reduce the future suffering in some degree.	Turashobora gutangura kubana neza n’ibidukikije. Turashobora no kuja mu barwanira ibidukikije kugira ngo tugabanye ibibi biterwa n’ukutabikingira.
This is just like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we do not only want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems, and we should deactivate them.	Ibi bimeze nko kuvura. Nimba tudashaka ko bibandanya, twari dukwiye kurondera intandaro y’ibibazo hanyuma tukazikuraho.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed much because of humankind's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and mankind's extravagant lifestyle.	Biraboneka ko isi yahindutse cane kubera iterambere ry’ubuhinga n’ubumenyi, kandi ko ibibazo vyabaye vyinshi kubera igwirirana ry’abantu be no kubaho nabi kwabo.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap.	Inyuma yo kwemezwa n’imana nshingamateka ku wa 4 Mukakaro, itegeko ryashizweko umukono n’uwurongoye inama nshingamateka John Hancock hamwe n’umunyamabanga Charles Thomson, ryaciye rirungikwa gusohorwa mw'isohorero rya John Dunlap.
"Through the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as ""Dunlap broadsides""."	"Mw’ijoro rimwe hakozwe kopi ziri hagati ya 150 na 200, ubu zizwi nka ""Dunlap Broadsides""."
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.	Iri tegeko ryasomwe ubwa mbere ku mugaragaro na John Nixon mu nzu y’amakoraniro yitiriwe ukwikukira ku wa 8 Mukakaro.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.	Ikopi imwe yararungikiwe George Washington ku wa 6 Mukakaro, nawe aca ararisomera ingabo ziwe kuwa 9 Mukakaro. Kopi yashitse Ku mwugwa mukuru w’Ubwongereza kuwa 10 Myandagaro.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.	Hasigaye amakopi yonyene mu mpapuro ziswe 25 Dunlap broadsides. Izari zanditswe n’iminwe ntazikiriho.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.	Benshi mu bashakashatsi bajejwe kwiga ibjanye na kahise k’abantu n’akibikoko bemeza ko bimwe mu bikoko vyitwa dinozoro vyoba bikiriho. Ubu tuzita inyoni.
Many people don't think about them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.	Abantu benshi ntibibaza ko zoba ari dinozoro kuko zifise amababa kandi zishobora kuguruka.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.	Ariko hariho ibintu vyinshi inyoni zifise biboneka no kuri dinozoro.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two back legs like a T-Rex.	Zifise amaguru ariko ibigaragamba n’inzara, zirata amagi kandi zigira kumaguru abiri nka T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information which is coded in the form of binary numbers.	Mudasobwa zose zikoreshwa muri iki gihe zishingiye ku gukoresha amakuru yanditswe mu buryo bw’ibiharuro bibiri.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.	Ubu buhinga bushobora kugira igiharuro kimwe gusa, ni ukuvuga 0 canke 1, kandi ivyo biharuro nivyo bizwi nka bibiri canke bakavyita bits iyo hakoreshejwe imvugo nyayo.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.	Ishano rirashobora kudashoka ryibonekeza. Ibimenyestso, nko kudahwa, birakunda kuboneka kenshi ku buryo ko umuntu atotera aronderera mw’ishano.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.	Ikimenyetso ca mbere c’uburozi ni nko kubona icupa ry’umuti ryuguruye canke icupa ry’iyindi miti umuntu akoresha munzu ariko yica.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.	Raba agapapuro kanditseko ivyo umuntu yokora ubwa mbere kuri ubwo burozi.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.	Ijambo igihere ni ryo rikunda gukoreshwa n’abahinga banonosoye ivy’udukoko dutoduto mu kuvuga uyu mugwi w’udukoko.
This term derives from ancient familiarity with Bed-bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.	Iryo jambo riva ku bihere bisanzwe abantu bamye bamenyereye kuva kera. Ni udukoko tumenyereye rwose kuba ku mubiri w’umuntu tumurya.
Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are nidicolous, adapted to living in nest or housing of their host.	Ibihere biryana mu maso n’ibihere bisanzwe vyose biguma mu vyari bikivuka. Biramenyereye kuba mu vyari vyazo canke mu nzu y’igikoko canke umuntu.
Across the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), leaving it as the leading neurological disease in younger and middle aged adults.	Hirya no hino muri Leta z’unze ubumwe za Amerika, hari abantu bagera ku 400.000 bagwaye ingwara yo mu bwonko izwi nka (MS). Ivyo bituma ariyo ngwara ya mbere urwaruka n‘abakuze barwaye cane.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve.	Ingwara ya MS ifatira cane cane hagati na hagati mu bwonko, igafata igice c'umugongo igaca ifata kandi imitsi ifasha kubona neza.
Research has found that females are two times more likely to have MS then males.	Ubushakashatsi bwerekanye ko igitsina gore aribo bakunda kugwara iyi ngwara incuro zibiri kuruta igitsina gabo.
A couple may decide it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a baby.	Abubakanye barashobora guhitamwo ko atanyungu babona mu kurera umwana.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.	Aba bubakanye barashobora guhitamwo kureresha umwana wabo.
In an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple may parent the child.	Mu kureresha umwana, abavyeyi b'amaraso baba biyatse ububasha bwose bafise ku mwana kugira babuhe abandi bavyeyi bagiye kurera uwomwana.
Science’s main goal is to figure out the way the world works through the scientific method. This method in fact guides most scientific research.	Intumbero nyamukuru ya siyansi ni ukumenya uburyo isi ikora biciye muburyo bw’ubuhinga. Ubu buryo nibwo buja imbere ubushakashatsi bwa siyansi.
It isn’t alone though, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.	Sico conyene, ubushakashatsi ni kimwe mu bikoreshwa gutorera inyishu kimwe canke vyinshi mu bibazo hanyuma bukanatanga ivyiyumviro bifasha mubundi bushakashatsi.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Bible in Latin.	Abahinga mubijanye na kamere n’imibereho yabantu bisunze cane inyandiko za kera, cane cane Bibiliya yari mu kilatini.
Accepted were Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology.	Ivyiyumviro vyari vyemewe cane muvya siyansi n’ibijanye n’imibereho y’abantu, vyari ivya Aristote.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.	Mugihe ubumenyi bw’ikigiriki bwagenda buragabanuka, Ibihugu vyo mu burayi vyisanze bitacitaho cane ibijanye na siyansi hamwe na kamere k'abantu vyo mu Bugiriki.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.	Uravye neza ingene vyitwara, yaba mu bijanye n’umubiri canke ingendo yavyo, biboneka ko vyoba bivana n’ingene bibayeho buri munsi hamwe n’ingene birondoka.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.	Ibijanye n’uko ibikoko bibaho, arinavyo nyinshu mu bijanye n’ibimeneyetso vy’ibihe, vyarizwe cane ku binyabuzima vyinshi harimwo udukoko dutera indwara, ibizinu, ibiterwa hamwe n’ibikoko.
Biological clocks are self sustaining oscillators which will continue a period of free-running cycling even in the absence of external cues.	Amasha y'ibinyabuzima ni nk’inzira y’umuyagankuba ubandanya kubaho naho hoba hataraboneka ibindi bintu bivuye hanze vyovyerekana.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.	Ubushakashatsi bwa Hershey na Chase ni kimwe muntererazo zerekanye ko ADN ari selile ikoze umuntu.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.	Hershey na Chase bakoresheje virusi, kugirango batere ADN yabo muri bagiteri.
They did two experiments marking either the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.	Bakoze ubushakashatsi bubiri, bumwe aho bateye ADN irimwo fosifore iyindi yari proteyine iteye irimwo sulfora.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells.	Uguhinduka gushobora kugira ingaruka zitandukanye bivanye n'ubwoko bwo guhinduka. Murizo ngaruka harimwo nimba igicee kigize ubuzima cahindutse canke nimba ama selile yafashwe yoba ari ama selile akomeye atuma ikinyabuzima gihinduka.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.	Gusa iyo sellile zikuru z'umuntu zihindutse, zirashobora kwandukira no ku bana uwo muntu azovyara, mu gihe ihinduka ryo kubindi bice rishobora gutuma umuntu apfa canke bigatera kanseri.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.	Ukwidagadura gushingiye ku binyabuzima gukwega cane abantu ko boja gutemberea ahari ivyiza kama kugira ngo batembere mu bibanza kama harimwo nibinyabuzima bitandukanye, k'ibikoko n'ibiterwa.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.	Umuntu yagiye kwidagadura arshobora guhiga, kuroba, gufata amafoto y’inyoni, kuga ahari ibikoko no kwiga kubijanye n’ibinyabuzima.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about organgatuangs in Borneo.	Akarorero ni nko gutembera, gufotora no kwiga ibijanye n’imafu zo muri Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is the place they have just left.	Buri gitondo, abantu bava mu bisagara bito bito mu miduka baja gukora mu bisagara binini bagaca bahura n'abandi akazi kabo kari murivyo bisagara bavuyemwo.
In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone is somehow connected with, and supporting, a transport system based on private cars.	Muriyi ngendeshwa, abantu bose bari ku murongo kandi barashigikiye ukwiyunguruza gushingiye ku modoka zitamenyerewe.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has dislodged the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.	Ubu siyanse yerekana ko ubwo butunzi bwa karubone bwahungabanije ahari itanguriro rw’ibinyabuzima kandi ryari ryarafashije mu kubaho kw’abantu mu myaka imiliyoni zibiri iheze.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.	Umuntu wese arafise uruhara mu kibano, kandi arakoresha uburyo bwo kwiyunguruza. Abantu hafi bose baridogera ibijanye nuburyo bwo kwiyunguruza.
In developed countries you seldom hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling down.	Mu bihugu biteye imbere, ni gake wokwumva abantu bidogera amazi canker ibiraro vyasambutse.
Why do transportation systems engender such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?	Ni kuberiki none abantu bidogera ibijanye no kwiyunguruza buri munsi?ni hehe bipfira?abajejwe gutwara ibintu n’abantu ntavyo bashoboye? Canker hari ibindi tutazi bibitera?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with one another.	Hari cigwa kijanye no kwiga ingene abashoferi bagenda be no kwiga ingene imodoka zisanzwe zigenda n’ingene zibisanya hagati yazo citwa ivyigwa vy'uruja nuruza.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one-hundred percent certainty.	Ariko rero, kwiga ibijanye n'uruja n'uruza ntivyoroshe kuko ntawomenya ingene umushoferi aza kwitwara ijana kw'ijana.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic streams tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.	Ariko rero, abashoferi barakunda kwitwara neza; ivyo bigatuma uruja n’uruza rworoha kandi rushobora kwigwa hakoreshejwe ibiharuro.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.	Kugirango umuntu yerekane neza uruja n’uruza, harashizweho isano hagati y’ibintu bitatu bikuru bikuru : (1) umurindi, (2)ukugwirirana , n’ (3) umuvuduko.
These relationships help in planning, design, and operations of roadway facilities.	Iri sano rifasha mu gutegura, gushushanya, hamwe no gukora ibikorwa bijanye n’amabarabara.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.	Udukoko duto nizo nyamaswa za mbere zagurutse. Ubushobozi bwatwo bwo kuguruka bwadufashije guhunga abansi hamwe no kuronka imfungurwa n’abafasha batwo vyoroshe.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.	Udukoko twinshi dufise ubushobozi bwo kunyegeza amababa yatwo ku mubiri.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.	Ivyo biduha uburyo bwinshi bwo gushobora kwinyegeza abansi batwo.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold back their wings are dragon flies and mayflies.	Uyu munsi, udukoko twonyene tudashobora kubika amababa kumubiri ni umugarye hamwe n’umunzerere.
Thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.	Haraciye imyaka ibihumbi iheze, hari umugabo yitwa Aristarchus yavuze ko ukwezi kuzunguruka iruhande y’izuba.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).	Abantu bamwe bibazako yari afise ukuri ariko abandi nabo bibaza ibitandukanye ; ko ukwezi kuzunguruka iruhande y’isi, harimwo n’izuba(mbere harimwo n’inyeyeri).
This seems sensible, because the Earth doesn't feel as if it's moving, does it?	Ibi bisa nk’ivyumvikana, kubera ko Isi tutumva iriko irazunguruka, sivyo none?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the biggest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second biggest river.	Uruzi rwa Amazon ni uruzi rwa kabiri rurerure kandi runini kw’isi. Rutwara amazi arenga incuro 8 ku ruzi rwa kabiri runini.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.	Amazone kandi ni uruzi rwagutse kw’isi, rimwe na rimwe ubwaguke bwa mayile zitandatu.
A full 20 percent of the water that pours out of the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.	Ibice 20% vy’amazi ava mu nzuzi aja mu biyaga ava mu ruzi Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.	Uruzi runini rwa Amazon rupima ibilometero 6.387 (mayile 3.980). Rwegeranya amaza ava mu zindi nzuzi ibihumbi.
Although pyramid-building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.	Nubwo kubaka piramide mu mabuye vyabandanie gushika kwiherezo ry’Ubwami bwa Kera, piramide za Giza ntizigeze zironka izizirusha mu bunini bwazo no mu buhinga zubatswemwo.
New Kingdom ancient Egyptians marvelled at their predecessors monuments, which were then well over a thousand year old.	Abanyamisiri ba kera bo mu Bwami bushasha baratangajwe n’ivyibutso vyakozwe n’ababatanguriye, ico gihe vyari bimaze imyaka irenga igihumbi.
Vatican City's population is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.	Igisagara ca Vatikani igife abantu bababa 800 bakibamwo. Nico gihugu gito ca mbere c’igenga kw'isi kandi nico gihugu gifise abantu bake.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.	Igisagara ca Vatikani gikoresha ururimi rw’Igitaliyani mu mategeko yaco no mwitumatumanako ry’amakuru ryemewe.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.	Igitaliyani nirwo rurimi rwa buri munsi rukoreshwa na benshi mubakorera muri leta mugihe ikilatini gikunze gukoreshwa mumigirwa y’idini.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.	Abenegihugu bose bo mu gisagara ca Vatikani ni Abakatolika.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from antiquity, as these can all be discovered in nature in native form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.	Abantu bamenye ibintu bya shimi nka zahabu, feza, n'umuringa kuva kera, kuko ivyo vyose birashobora kuronkwa mw’ishamba bimeze neza kandi biroroha kuronka hakoreshejwe ibikoresho bisanzwe.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorised that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.	Aristote, umuhinga muvya filozofiya, yavuze ko ibintu byose bigizwe nuruvange rw'ikintu kimwe canke vyinshi mu bintu bine. vyari isi, amazi, impwemu, n'umuriro.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, though he also theorised that they change into new substances to form what we see.	Ibi vyari bimeze nk’ibintu bine ibintu bishobora kubamwo(bitonze uko nyene): ibifadika,ibiseseka,ibintu bitumuka, n'ibishashara, naho vyatangajwe ko vyihindura mu bintu bishasha bigahinduka ivyo twebwe tubona.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.	Amaroyi ni uruvange rw'ivyuma bibiri canke vyinshi. Ntiwibagire ko hari ibintu vyinshi mu kibaho kivuga ivyuma biri kwisi
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.	Ibintu nka carisiyumu na potasiyumu bifatwa nk’ivyuma. Birumvikana kandi ko hariho ivyuma nka feza n’inzahabu.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.	Urashobora kandi kuronka amaroyi arimwo ibintu bike bitari ivyuma, nk'akarorero karubone.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.	Ibintu vyose biri mw’isi bikozwe mubindi bintu. Ibintu vyose navyo bigizwe n’uduce dutoto duto bita atome.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.	Atome ni nto cane kuburyo ama miliyaridi yayo ashobora kwinjira ahantu imbere yo guheza iri jambo.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.	Rero, ikaramu y’igiti yarakunzwe cane n’abantu igihe yasohoka igatangura gukora.
Sadly, as newer methods of writing have emerged, the pencil has been relegated to lesser status and uses.	Ikibabaje, inyuma y’uko hagiye haraza uburyo bushasha bwo kwandika, ikaramu y’igiti yagiye irata agaciro bakaza barayikoresha ibintu bitanyaye.
People now write messages on computer screens, never having to come close to a sharpener.	Ubu abantu bandika ubutumwa bakoresheje mudasobwa zabo, ntibagishaka gukoresha isongozo.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something newer comes along.	Umuntu arashobora kwibaza ingene inanganyabwonko izoba imeze nihaza ikintu gishasha.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.	Igisasu cya fission gikorera ku rufatiro rw’uko hategerezwa kuba hari inguvu zishira hamwe igitimbatimba na proto nyinshi na netro.
Sort of like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Splitting the nucleus up again then releases some of that energy.	Nkakurya woba uriko ukwega umukogote ku musozi. Ahari cagi timbatimba haca hasubira hakarekura izo nguvu.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they tend to break apart with little or no nudging.	Atome zimwe zimwe zifise intimbatimba itaguma hamwe, ibi bisigura ko zikunda gutandukana zidakozweko canke zikozweko bukebuke.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.	Uburinganire bw’ukwezi bugizwe n’ibibuye hamwe n’ivumbi. Igice c’inyuma citwa krute.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.	Krute ifise intimbatimba y’ibilometero 70 kuruhande rwegereye n’ibilometero 100 ku ruhande rwa kure.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.	Ironze kugice c’ama mariya hanyuma ikaguka munsi y'imisozi miremire.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise up to the surface.	Hashobora kuba ama mariya menshi ku ruhande rwo hafi kuko croute yonze. Biba vyoroshe ko ikurnga kiduga kikaja hejuru.
Content theories are centered on finding what makes people tick or appeals to them.	Ibijanye n’amajmbo canke ibivurwa bifatiye cane cane mu kumenya ico abantu bakunda kandi bakurikira.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires which have been internalized as they mature to adulthood.	Izi nyigisho zerekana ko abantu bafite ivyo bakeneye hamwe/canke ivyipfuzo bafise muribo kandi bikura mugihe bakuze.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that make them want the things that they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.	Izi nyigisho ziraba ico zivuga ku bantu bamwe bituma bashaka ibintu bakora n’ibintu mu bidukikije bizotuma bakora canker badakora ibintu runaka.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.	Inyigisho zizwi cane ni iza zibira iya Maslow ijanye ningene umuntu akenera ibintu bitannduknye hamwe niya Herzberg ijanye n’ibintu bibiri.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former peers. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain “one of the guys” (or gals).	Muri rusangi, hari ubwoko bubiri bwo kwitwara bushobora kuvuka iyo abayobozi batanguye gutwara abo bahora bakorana. Uruhande rumwe rugerageza kuba “nkaba basore” (canke za nkumi).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, performing disciplinary action, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.	Ubu bwoko bw’umuyobozi bufise ikibazo co gufata ingingo zidakunzwe n’abandi, gufata ibihano, gusuzuma ibikorwa, gutanga akazi kuri umwe umwe no kubazwa abantu.
At the other end of the spectrum, one morphs into an unrecognizable individual that feels he or she must change everything the team has been doing and make it their own.	Ku rundi ruhande rw’urukurikirane, umuntu aca ahinduka umuntu adatahuritse akumva ivyo abakozi bose bakoze aravyiyitirira.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.	Erega burya, umuyobozi niwe ashiznwe gutera imbere canker gusubira inyuma kw’abakozi.
This behavior oftentimes results in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.	Iyi ngeso kenshi itera ugushwana n’ugutandukana hagati y’abatware n’abandi bakozi.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.	Abakozi bakorera ku ngurukana bumenyi bafatwa co kimwe nabakorera ku biro mu bijanye nivyo bategerezwa gukora, ariko hari itandukaniro rito.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.	Abakozi bakorera ku ngurukana bumenyi bakunda gukora kenshi nkabahuza abakorera ku biro.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams may meet according to varying time zones which may not be understood by their local management.	Bakunze kugira ubwigenge burenze kubakorera ku biro kuko abo bakorana barashobora guhura naho boba batari kumasaha amwe naho bishobora kudatahurwa n’ubuyobozi bwaho.
The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.	Ukubaho “kwabakozi bataboneka” (Larson na LaFasto, 1989, urup109) naco ni kimwe mubigize abakorera ku ngurukana bumenyi.
The “invisible team” is the management team to which each of the members report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.	“Umugwi utaboneka” ni wo mugwi uhagarikira, ukaraba ivyo abagize umugwi bose bakora. Uwo mugwi utaboneka ni wo ushinga ivyo umwe wese mu bagize umugwi yisunga.
Why would an organization want to go through the time consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One goal for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.	Kubera iki ishirahamwe ryokwirirwa rirafata umwanya wo gutunganya ibijanye no gucisha ubwenge abarigize? Intumbero imwe ituma ivyiyumviro bijanye no gucisha ubwenge abagize ishirahamwe bishirwa mu ngiro ni ubwenge bwo kwiyumvira ibishasha.
When all available resources are effectively used across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can transpire.	Igihe ibikoresho vyose bihari bikoreshejwe neza mu bisata vy'ubuzima bw'ishirahamwe, ubuhanga bwo kwiyumvira ibintu bishasha n'ubugirigiri birashobora kwibonekeza.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the customer's need.	Iyo rero abagize ishirahamwe bakoreye hamwe kugira batsinde intambamyi kanaka, birashobora gutuma hiyumvirwa uburyo bushasha bwo gukora butuma abakiriya bitwararikwa.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.	Muko ishirahamwe rizana bishasha, abarirongoye bategerezwa gutuma mu barigize haba agatima ko kwiyumvira bishasha, ubumenyi busangiwe na bose hamwe n'ugucisha ubwenge abagize iryo shirahamwe.
Angel (2006), explains the Continuum approach as a method being used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.	Igitabu Angel (2006) kirasigura ko ubuhinga bwitwa Continuum bukoreshwa mu gufasha amashirahamwe gukora neza ku rwego rwo hejuru.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore it narrows the research area and makes it much more exact.	"Hari amakuru dukesha ubuhinga bwa ""neurobiologie"" atanga ibimenyamenya bifatiye ku mubiri vyerekana ko hari uburyo bushingiye ku vyiyumviro gusa bwofasha gutohoza ibijanye n'ubushobozi bwo kwiga. Bituma ubushakashatsi butaguka birenze, bukarushiriza no gutora vyo."
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.	Isano riri hagati y'inyifato n'indwara zifata ubwonko rirashigikira abahinga mu bushakashatsi bwabo.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumours affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.	Haraciye igihe kirekire bizwi ko ubwoko butandukanye bw'ukwononekara kw'ubwonko, imvune zabwo, ibikomere vyabwo n'ibivyimba, bihindura inyifato y'umuntu, bigatuma n'ibintu bimwebimwe ubwenge bukora bihinduka.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never seen before.	Ubuhinga bushasha buboneka buratuma dushobora kubona no gutohoza ibigize ubwonko n'ikora ryabo tutari bwigere tubona.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models which help us to understand processes in our mind.	Ivyo biraduha amakuru menshi n'ubumenyi twokoresha mu gutunganya ubuhinga bwigana ubwonko budufasha gutahura ikora ry'ubwenge bwacu.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.	Naho ubuhinga bwa IA busanishwa cane n'ibintu bitarabaho bishingiye kuri siyansi, ni umuce uhambaye cane w'ubuhinga bw'inyabwonko witaho ibijanye n'inyifato, ukwiga n'uguhuza n'uko ibintu vyifashe kurimwo ubwenge mu mashini.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.	Mu bushakashatsi bwa IA harimwo ugutuma imashini ziga kwibwiriza gukora ibintu bisaba ubwenge.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face.	Nk'akarorero ugusuzuma, ugutegekanya n'ugutegura aho ikintu kibera, ubushobozi bwo gutorera umuti ingorane n'ibibazo vy'umukiriya, gutahura ivyandikishijwe iminwe, mu maso h'umuntu n'ijwi.
Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real life problems.	Ivyo bintu bisigaye ari ibisata bitandukanye birondera gutorera umuti ingorane zibaho mu buzima.
The AI ​​system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as has been built in several home computer and video game software applications.	Ubuhinga bwa IA busigaye bukunda gukoreshwa mu vy'ubutunzi, mu vy'ubuvuzi, mu vy'ubuhinga bwo kwubaka ibintu no mu vya gisirikare, bukaba bwarashizwe mu nyabwonko zitari nke zo muhira no mu nkino za videwo.
Field trips are a large part of any classroom. Quite often a teacher would love to take her students places to which a bus trip is not an option.	Gutembera ni igikorwa gikomeye mw'isomero iryo ari ryo ryose. Kenshi umwigisha usanga yoshima kujana abanyeshure ahantu badashobora gushika na bisi.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.	Ubuhinga bwa none butuma bishoboka biciye ku ngendo zo kuri ubwo buhinga. Abanyeshure barashobora kwitegereza utugenegene two mw'iratiro, bagatembera aho barabira ibinyabuzima mu mazi, bakitegereza ishusho nziza cane, bibereye mw'isomero.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect a on a trip and share experiences with future classes.	Gutembera biciye ku buhinga bwa none biratanga n'akaryo keza ko kwiyumvira urwo rugendo maze mukazoyagira abandi banyeshure ivyo mwabonye.
For example, each year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital, each year the website gets remodeled, but old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.	Nk'akarorero, buri mwaka abanyeshure bo kw'ishure ryitwa Bennet muri Karolina ya Ruguru baratunganya urubuga ngurukanabumenyi aho berekana urugendo bagize ku mugwa mukuru wa Reta. Buri mwaka urwo rubuga rurasubirwamwo, mugabo ivya kera bigumako kugira baze barashirako utuntu dushasha.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often begin their blog experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes that.	Imbuga zitwa blogs na zo nyeneye zirashobora gufasha abanyeshure kuryohora ubuhinga bwo kwandika. Naho mu ntango abanyeshure kenshi batangura kwandika kuri izo mbuga ata kwubahiriza neza indimburo n'inyandiko y'amajambo, kuba izo mbuga zijako n'abandi bituma kenshi baryohora.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to strive to improve writing to avoid criticism.	Kubera ko abanyeshure ari bo usanga kenshi bagira ico babivuzeko, umwanditsi w'urwo rubuga aca aza araryohora ingene yandika kugira ntibamucishemwo ijisho.
"Also blogging ""forces students to become more savvy about the world around them."" The need to feed the interest of the audience inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004)."	"Kwandika kuri blog ""birahatira abanyeshure kurondera kumenya cane isi ibakikuje."" Bararushiriza guca ubwenge no kwandika ibishimisha kubera baba bashaka kunezereza abaja ku rubuga rwabo (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning well beyond the traditional school day.	Kwandika blog biratuma abanyeshure bakorera hamwe, bikanabaremesha kurondera ubumenyi n'ahandi turetse kw'ishure.
"Appropriate use of blogs ""can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings as well as outline their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002)."	"Gukoresha neza imbuga za blogs ""birashobora gutuma barushiriza kuba abantu bihweza kandi badapfa kwemera ibintu; mu gutanga ivyiyumviro ku vyo babonye kuri Internet, abanyeshure barashobora kwerekana aho bahagaze ku vyo abandi banditse no ku bindi bibazo kanaka (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and features an array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.	Ottawa ni wo murwa mukuru umeze neza wa Kanada.

In the archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.	Mu mugwi w’amazinga no mu biyaga, ntibikenewe cane gukoresha ubwato bunini.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the biggest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.	Naho umugwi w’amazinga yo hafi y'inkengera hamwe n’ibiyaga binini vyagutse ku buryo vyokwakira ubwato ubwo ari bwo bwose, ubwato butobuto canke ubwitwa kayake butuma wiyumva ukundi.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat to every seven or eight people.	Gutembera mu bwato ni uburyo bwo kuryoherwa muri Finilande, aho usanga hari ubwato bumwe ku bantu indwi canke umunani.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one to forty).	Ivyo birakorwa no muri Noroveji, Swede no muri Nuvere Zerande, ariko hoho hari ico hisangije (akarorero: mu Buholande usanga ari ubwato bumwe ku bantu mirongine.
Most of the distinct Baltic Cruises feature an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.	Menshi muma Meri y'i Balte atandukanye aratanga akaryo ko kumara igihe kirekire i St. Petersburg, mubu Russia.

If you only go ashore using shipboard excursions you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).	Iyo mwururutse ubwato mukoresheje ingendo shuri gusa ntimuzoba mukeneye viza itandukanye (guhera 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see from the map above Berlin is no where near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.	Ama meri amwamwe yerekana Berlin, m' Ubudagi mu dutabu nyigisho.

It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes of other things that very many people have.	Si ikintu cogutera isoni: ntigitandukanye n' ubwoba bw'umuntu bwite hamwe no kudakunda kw'ibindi bintu abantu benshi cane bafise.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight may help to overcome a fear which is based on the unknown or on not being in control.

Abakingira ibibuga vy'indege ntibazobemerera ko barungika ishakoshi itarikumwe n'ingenzi, aho rero niho uca uvyinjiriramwo.
The obvious way of flying in first or business class is to fork out a thick wad of money for the privilege (or, better yet, get your company to do it for you).

However, this does not come cheap: as rough rules of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business, and eleven times for first class!	Ariko ibi ntibizimbutse: muri rusangi urashobora kwitega kuriha gushika ku ncuro zine igiciro co mu bibanza bisanzwe ku bibanza vy'abafata ingendo z'akazi, n’incuro cumi n'imwe ku bibanza vya mbere!
Generally speaking, there is no point in even looking for discounts for business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.	Muri rusangi, nta n’impamvu yo kurondera kugabanirizwa ibiciro vyo mu bibanza vya mbere canke vy'abafata ingendo z'akazi ku ndenge ziva hamwe zigashika ahandi zitarinze guhagarara.

Ikompanyi z’indege zirazi neza ko hariho umugwi w’ingenzi ziteguriye kuriha ibiciro bihanitse vy’amadorari kugira zironke akarusho ko gushika ahantu zinyarutse kandi zimerewe neza, hama zikabifatirako mu kurihisha.
