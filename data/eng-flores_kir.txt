The couple had married in Texas one year ago and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.	Ubugeni bw'abakundana bwabereye i Texas umwaka urarangiye baciye baza i Buffalo kugira umusi mukuru barikumwe n'abagenzi n'abaryango.
The 30-year-old husband, who was born in Buffalo, was one of the four killed in the shooting, but his wife was not hurt.	Umugabo afise imyaka 30, yavukiye i Buffaro, yarumwe muri bane bishwe barashwe ariko umugore wiwe ntiyigeze akomereka.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English tutor who taught under Modern Education and King's Glory who claimed to have 9,000 students at the peak of his career.	"Karno n'umwigisha w'icongereza azwi neza ariko atavugwako rumwe yigishije muburyo bwa ""Modern Education and King's Glory"" yigamvye kuba afise abanyeshure ibihumbi icenda mugihe akazi kiwe kari gahurumbirwa."
In his notes he used words which some parents considered coarse, and he reportedly used profanity in class.	Munyandiko ziwe yarakoresha amajambo abavyeyi bamwe bamwe bafata nk'igishegu, kandi yarakoresha namajambo yogutukana ari mwishure.
Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without authorisation and lying by saying that he was the chief English tutor.	Modern Education yaramwagirije ko yasohoye amatangazo menshi yo kwamamaza mumiduga yunguruza abantu atabiherewe uburenganzira kandi akabesha kwariwe mwigisha mukuru w'Icongereza.
He has also been accused previously of copyright infringement, but was not charged.	Rimwe — Brian Babin — yatoye mu bisanzwe 'pereza' mu gihe abandi mirongo ibiri na bane batoye mu butandukane bw'abandi bitoje.
A former student said that he 'used slang in class, taught dating skills in notes, and was just like the students' friend.'	Uwahoze ari umunyeshure yavuze ko yakoresha amajambo y'akagwi mw'ishure, akigisha ubuhinga bwo kuresha munyandiko eka yari nk'umugenzi w'abanyeshure.
During the last three decades, despite officially remaining a communist state, China has developed a market economy.	Mugihe c'imyaka mirongo itatu iheze, nubwo yari yagumye ari leta ya gikoministe, Ubushinwa bwarateje imbere amasoko y'ubutunzi.
The first economic reforms were made under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.	Impinduka zambere mubutunzi zakozwe kuburongozi bwa Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economic size has grown by 90 times.	Kuvubwo, ikigereranyo c'ubutunzi bw'Ubushinwa cigwijije n'incuro 90.
For the first time, last year China exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the United States as the biggest market for this industry.	Bwarubwanbere, mumwaka uheze, Ubushinwa bushoye hanze amamodoka menshi gusumvya Ubudagi bukanacako Leta Zunze Ubumwe nk'isoko nkuru kuriryo hinguriro.
China's GDP could be larger than the United States within two decades.	Umwimbu w'imbere Mugihugu c'Ubushinwa ushobora kuba uri hejuru y'uwa Reta zunze ubumwe muri bino binyacumi bibiri.
Tropical Storm Danielle, fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.	Igihuhusi co muri toropike Danielle, kigira kane ciswe izina mugihe c'ibihuhusi vya Atlantique muri 2010, citeranirije mubuseruko bw'Inyanja ya Atlantique.
The storm, located approximately 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 kph).	Igihuhusi kiri nko ku ntambuko ibihumbi bitatu ya Miami muri Folorida gifise imiyaga mikuru mikuru ya 40 mph (64 kph).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will strengthen to a hurricane by Wednesday.	Abashakashatsi ba National Hurricane Center bategekanya ko Daniella kizokwikusaniriza mu gihuhusi kuwagatatu.
As the storm is far from landfall, it remains difficult to assess potential impact to the United States or Caribbean.	Nkuko igihuhusi kiri kure kugira gishikire isi, biragoye gusuzuma inkurikizi zitezwe zaco kuri reta zunze ubumwe canke Karayibe.
Born in the Croatian capital, Zagreb, Bobek gained fame while playing for Partizan Belgrade.	Yavukiye i Zagreb umugwa mukuru wa Croate, Bobek yamenyekanye mugihe yakinira Partizan Belgrade.
He joined them in 1945 and stayed until 1958.	Yifadikanije nabo mu 1945 aca agumayo gushika mu 1958.
During his time with the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 appearances.	Mugihe ciwe hamwe n'umugwi, yatsinze ibitsindo 403 munkino 468.
No one else has ever made more appearances or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.	Ntawundi muntu yigeze aja munkino canke ngo atsindire umugwi gusumvya Bobek.
In 1995 he was voted the best player in Partizan's history.	Mu 1995, yatowe ko ari umukinyi wakarorero wa Partizan muri kahise.
The celebrations started with a special show by the world-renowned group Cirque du Soleil.	Amahimbazwa yatangujwe n'igiteramo c'agakura c'umurwi uzwi kw'isi nzima Cirque du Soleil.
It was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a Janissary band, and the singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.	Yakurikiwe na Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, umugwi wa Janissary, hamwe n'abaririmvyi Fatih Erkoç na Müslüm Gürses.
Then Whirling Dervishes took to the stage.	Hanyuma abatamba bizunguriza nkakamari baciye baduga kukibanza c'intambo.

Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, has died after being involved in a crash at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.	Peter Lenz, umunyonzi wihonda afise imyaka 13 yapfiriye mwisanganya i 'Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
While on his warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his bike, and was then struck by fellow racer Xavier Zayat.	Mugihe yariko arishusha, Lenz yatibutse ava kw'ikinga ryiwe, hama aca abomwa na mugenzi we mw'irushanwa Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately attended to by the on-track medical staff and transported to a local hospital where he later died.	Yaciye akurikiranwa ubwonyene n'umugwi w'aganga bari ku nzira hama acajanwa kubitaro vyari hafi aho yatevye apfira.
Zayat was unhurt in the accident.	Zayat ntiyigeze akomerekera mwisanganya.
"Regarding the global financial situation, Zapatero continued by saying that ""the financial system is a part of the economy, a crucial part."	"Kubijanye nukuntu ubutunzi bwisi buhagaze, Zapatero yakurikije avuga yuko ""inyubako y'ubutunzi ari igice gihambaye cane."
"We have a year-long financial crisis, which has had its most acute moment in the past two months, and I think now the financial markets are beginning to recover."""	"Turafise ikibazo c'ubutunzi c'umwaka wose, vyunyutse cane mumezi abiri aheze, nkiyumvira ko ubu amasoko y'ubutunzi yatanguye guhembuka."""
Last week, Naked News announced that it would dramatically increase its international language mandate to news reporting, with three new broadcasts.	Mundwiheze, Naked News yatangaje ko ishobora kwongereza ikiringo cayo co kuvuga indimi zinyamahanga mukuvuga amakuru, hamwe nibiganiro bishsha bitatu.
Already reporting in English and Japanese, the global organization is launching Spanish, Italian, and Korean-language programs, for television, the web, and mobile devices.	Hamaze kwerekanwa ibiganiro mucongereza no mukiyapani, ibihugu vyishize hamwe kwisi vyatanguje iyindi migambi muki espanyole, igitaliano n'igikoreya, kumboneshakure, k'ubuhinga ngurukana bumenyi hamwe no kubikoresho ngendanwa.
"""Luckily nothing happened to me, but I saw a macabre scene, as people tried to break windows in order to get out."	Ikiryoshe, nuko atanakimwe canshikiye, ariko narabonye inyifato zibabaje mugihe abantu bariko bagerageza kumena ibiyo ngo basohoke.
People were hitting the panes with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.	Abantu bakubita ibiyo n'intebe z'inyegamo ariko ibiyo vyari ibitameneka.
"One of the panes finally broke, and they started to get out by the window,"" said survivor Franciszek Kowal."	"""Kimwe murivyo biyo cahavuye kimeneka hama baca batangura gusohoka baciye mwidirisha,"" vyavuzwe nuwarokotse Franciszek Kowal."
Stars give off light and heat because of the energy made when hydrogen atoms are merged (or fused) together to form heavier elements.	Inyenyeri zitanga umuco n'ubushuhe kubera inguvu zikozwe iyo atome za idrojene ziteranijwe (canke zishongesherejwe) hamwe kugira bikore ibintu biremereye gusumba.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that can make energy in the same way.	Abashakashatsi bariko barahingura imashine ishobora gutanga inguvu cokimwe nizo nyenyeri.
This, however, is a very hard problem to solve and will take many years before we see useful fusion reactors built.	Ico, vyongeye, ningorane igoye cane gukemura kandi izosaba imyaka myinshi imbere yuko haboneka amamashine y'ihuza afise akamaro yubatswe.
The steel needle floats on top of the water because of surface tension.	Urushinge rwa asye rureremba kumazi kubera inguvu ziyariko.
Surface tension happens because the water molecules at the surface of the water are strongly attracted to each other more than they are to the air molecules above them.	Inguvu ziri kuriyo zikorwa kuberako amamolekire y'amazi ari kuburinganire bw'amazi akwegwa cane hagati yayo gusumba uko akwegwa n'ama molekile y'umuyaga hejuru yayo.
The water molecules make an invisible skin on the water’s surface that allows things like the needle to float on top of the water.	Amamolekire y'amazi akora urukoba rutaboneka kuburinganire bw'amazi bituma ibintu nkurushinge bireremba hejuru y'amazi.
The blade on a modern ice skate has a double edge with a concave hollow between them. The two edges allow for a better grasp of the ice, even when tilted.	Urubaho rwo kw'inyerezako k'urubura rugezweho rufise impande zibiri hamwe n'ikinogo gifukuye hagati yazo. Izo mpande zibiri zifasha gufata neza urubura, naho nzohengamikwa.
Because the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, as the blade tilts to one side or the other, the edge which is in contact with the ice also curves.	Kuberako indiba z'urubaho rwo kw'inyerezako ruzinzeko buke buke, mugihe urubaho rwo kw'inyerezako ruhengetse kuruhande rumwe canke urundi, uruhande ruriko urubura rurizinga nagwo.
This causes the skater to turn. If the skates tilt to the right, the skater turns right, if the skates tilt to the left, the skater turns left.	Ibi bituma uwunyerera kurubura ahindukira. Mugihe udukoresho two kwinyereza twihindukije muburyo, uwunyerera kurubura azunguruka iburyo, iyo udukoresho two kwinyereza tugiye ibubamfu, uwunyerera kurubura aca azunguruka ibubamfu.
To return to their previous energy level, they must get rid of the extra energy they got from the light.	Kugira zigaruke kurugero rwazo rwinguvu, zitegerezwa kwikurako inguvu zirengako zari zakuye k'umuco.
"They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a ""photon""."	"Zibikora mukurungika uduhimba duto duto tw'umuco twitwa ""photon""."
"Scientists call this process ""stimulated emission of radiation"" because the atoms are stimulated by the bright light, causing the emission of a photon of light, and light is a type of radiation."	"Abashakashatsi bataziriye urwo rukurikirane ""irungikwa rikabuwe n'imishwarara"" kubera ko uduhimba dutoduto tw'ikintu dukaburwa n'umuco wamuje, bigakwega irungikwa ry'ama photons y'umuco, kandi umuco nawo ni ubwoko bw'umushwarara."
The next picture shows the atoms emitting photons. Of course, in reality photons are a lot smaller than those in the picture.	Ifoto ikurikira yerekana ama atome arekura ama photons. Nivyo cane, mukuri, ama photons ni mato cane ugereranije n'ayari kw'ifoto.
Photons are even smaller than the stuff that makes up atoms!	Ama photons ni na mato cane ugereranije n'uduhimba tugize ama atome!
After hundreds of hours of operation the filament in the bulb eventually burns out and the light bulb no longer works.	Inyuma y'amasaha amajana itara ririko rirakora, akuma gato kari imbere mw'itara birangira gahiye hama itara rikareka gukora.
The light bulb then needs replacing. It is necessary to be careful in replacing the light bulb.	Itara rirategerezwa guhindurwa. Birasabwa kwitonda cane muguhindura itara.
First, the switch for the light fixture needs to be turned off or the cable disconnected.	Ubwambere, bishakirwa ko amatara aba azimije canke kable igacomorwa.
This is because electricity flowing into the socket where the metallic part of bulb sits can give you a severe electric shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the bulb while it is still partly in the socket.	Ivyo ni kubera umuyagankuba utembera mw'isoke aho igice c'icuma ca ampure kija ushobora kugukubita iyo ukoze indani mw'i soke canke ku ntango ry'icuma co kuri ampure igihe igice kikiri mw' isoke.
The major organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps the blood.	Igihimba nyamukuru mw'itembera ry'amaraso ni umutima, wo urungika amaraso.
Blood goes away from the heart in tubes called arteries and comes back to the heart in tubes called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.	Amaraso ava mu mutima aciye mu miringoti yitwa artères, akagarukayo aciye mu turingoti twitwa veines, Uturingoti dutoyi gusumba twose twitwa capillaires.
A triceratops' teeth would have been able to crush not only leaves but even very tough branches and roots.	Amenyo y'ivyo bikoko vyitwa tricératops, biboneka ko atashobora guhekenya gusa amababi mugabo ko yashobora no guhekenya amashami n'imizi bigumye.
Some scientists think Triceratops ate cycads, which are a type of plant that was common in the Cretaceous.	Hari abahinga biyumvira ko ivyo bikoko vyitwa tricératops vyarya ibimera vyitwa cycades vyari bigwiriye mu kiringo citwa crétacé.
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of sharp, spiky leaves.	Ivyo bimera womengo ni utugazi, bikaba vyikoreye igishurwe c'utubabibabi dushinze kandi dusongoye.
A Triceratops could have used its strong beak to strip off the leaves before eating the trunk.	Igikoko tricératops gishobora kuba carakoresha urunwa rwaco rukomeye mu gukura amababi ku giti imbere yo kukirya.
Other scientists argue that these plants are very poisonous so it is unlikely that any dinosaur ate them, even though today the sloth and other animals like the parrot (a descendant of the dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.	Abandi bahinga bo bavuga ko ivyo bimera birimwo ubumara bwinshi ku buryo bisa n'uko ata dinozoro n'imwe yari kubirya, naho muri iki gihe igikoko citwa paresseux n'ibindi bikoko nka gasuku (yakomotse ku madinozoro) bishobora kurya amababi canke ivyamwa vy'ubumara.
How would Io's gravity pull on me? If you stood on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than you do on Earth.	Ukwezi Io kwonkwega gute? Hamwe wohagarara ku kwezi Io, wopima ibilo biri munsi y'ivyo upima uri kw'isi.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io. So the gravity, of course, pulls less on you.	Umuntu apima amapawundi 200 (ibilo 90) kw'isi yoca apima amapawundi nka 36 (ibilo 16) kuri Io. Rero ukwo kwezi ntikwogukwega cane nk'isi.
The Sun doesn't have a crust like the Earth that you can stand on. The whole Sun is made out of gases, fire, and plasma.	Izuba ntirifise ubutaka nk'ubw'isi wohagararako. Izuba ryose rigizwe n'imyuka, umuriro n'ivyitwa plasma.
The gas becomes thinner as you go farther from the center of the Sun.	Uko uja kure y'intimatima y'izuba, ni ko umwuka ugenda uragabanuka.
"The outer-part we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means ""ball of light""."	"Igice c'inyuma tubona igihe twitegereje izuba citwa photosphère, bisobanura ngo ""imburungu y'umuco""."
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases, just as the moon does.	Inyuma y'imyaka nk'ibihumbi bitatu, mu 1610, umuhinga w'ivyo mu kirere w'Umutaliyano yitwa Galileo Galilei yarakoresheje itarubindi arabona yuko ishusho ya Venisi igenda irahinduka, cokimwe n'ukwezi.
Phases happen because only the side of Venus (or of the Moon) facing the Sun is lighted. The phases of Venus supported the theory of Copernicus that the planets go around the Sun.	Amahindagurika y'ishusho aba kubera ko igice ca Venisi (canke c'ukwezi) kirabana n'izuba ari co kimukirwa. Amahindagurika y'ishusho ya Venisi yaremeje imibumbe izunguruka izuba nk'uko Copernicus yari yaravyiyumviriye.
Then, a few years later in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.	Maze haciye imyaka mike, mu 1639, umuhinga w'ivyo mu kirere w'Umwongereza yitwa Jeremiah Horrocks yaritegereje irengana rya Venisi.
England had experienced a long period of peace after the reconquest of the Danelaw.	Ubwongereza bwari bwamaze igihe kirekire mu mahoro inyuma yo guhabuza Danelaw.
However in 991 Ethelred was faced with a Viking fleet larger than any since Guthrum's a century earlier.	Mugabo mu 991 Ethelred yarahanganye n’amato y’Abavikingi asumba ayandi yose yabayeho inyuma y’aya Guthrum mu kinjana c’imbere yaho.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with ambitions to reclaim his country from Danish domination.	Ayo mato yari arongowe na Olaf Trygvasson, Umunyanoroveji yari afise intumbero yo guhabuza igihugu ciwe ngo kireke kuganzwa na Danemarike.
After initial military setbacks, Ethelred was able to agree to terms with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to gain his kingdom with mixed success.	Inyuma yo gutsindwa mu ntambara za mbere, Ethelred yarashoboye kwumvikana na Olaf, uwo na we aca asubira muri Noroveji kugerageza guhabuza ingoma yiwe, rimwerimwe atsinda ikindi gihe na ho atsindwa.
Hangeul is the only purposely invented alphabet in popular daily use. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418 – 1450).	Mu nkurikirane z'indome ziyumviriwe zigatunganywa, Hangeul ni rwo rwonyene rukoreshwa cane buri musi. Rwatunganijwe mu 1444 ku ntwaro y'Umwami Sejong (1418 – 1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and is one of the most highly regarded.	Umwami Sejong yagira kane mu bami bo mu muryango w'aba Joseon kandi ni umwe mu bubahwa cane.
"He originally named the Hangeul alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum, which means ""the correct sounds for the instruction of the people""."	"Mu ntango, urwo rukirikirane rw'indome yarwise Hunmin Jeongeum, bisobanura ngo ""amajwi atomoye yo kwigisha abantu""."
There are many theories to how Sanskrit came into existence. One of them is about an Aryan migration from the west into India who brought their language with them.	Hiyumvirwa vyinshi ku nkomoko y'ururimi rwa sanskrit. Hari abiyumvira ko rwatanguye igihe abantu bo mu bwoko bw'Abariyeni bava mu burengero bakimukira mu Buhindi, bajanayo ururimi rwabo.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the Latin language spoken in Europe.	Sanskrit ni ururimi rwa kera, rukaba rwogereranywa n'ikilatini cavugwa i Buraya.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of Upanishads, Sanskrit just faded due to hierarchy.	Igitabu ca kera kuruta vyose kw'isi canditswe mu rurimi rwa sanskrit. Ibisomwa vyitwa oupanishad bimaze kwegeranywa, urwo rurimi rwaciye ruzimangana kubera abakuru.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which has served to be the source for many modern Indian languages, just like Latin is the source for European languages like French and Spanish.	Sanskrit ni ururimi ruhanitse kandi rutunze cane, rukaba rwarakomotseko indimi nyinshi zo mu Buhindi zo muri iki gihe, nk'uko n'ikilatini rwakomotseko indimi z'i Buraya nk'igifaransa n'iki-esupanyoli.
With the battle for France over, Germany began to get ready to invade the island of Britain.	Urugamba rwo kwigarurira Ubufaransa rurangiye, Ubudagi bwaciye butangura kwitegurira gutera izinga ry'Ubwongereza.
Germany code-named the attack “Operation Sealion”. Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and supplies had been lost when it evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was fairly weak.	Ubudagi bwise ico gitero “Opération Lion de mer”. Vyinshi mu birwanisho bikomeye n'ibintu vy'igisoda c'Ubwongereza vyari vyatakaye igihe cava i Dunkirk. Rero igisoda hari ukuntu cagoyagoya.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (“Kriegsmarine”) and could have destroyed any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel.	Mugabo Igisoda co mu mazi c'Ubwongereza cari kigikomeye gusumba ic'Ubudagi (“Kriegsmarine”), kikaba carashobora gusambura amato yose y'umwansi agerageje kujabuka amazi yaho yitwa la Manche.
However, very few Royal Navy ships were based near the likely invasion routes as the admirals were afraid they would be sunk by German air attack.	Yamara, amato makeyi cane y'ico Gisoda co mu mazi ni yo yari hafi y'aho ibitero vyashobora kuzanana, kuko abakuru b'igisoda co mu mazi batinya ko ayo mato agwa mu gitero c'indege z'Abadagi.
"Let's start with an explanation about Italy's plans. Italy was mainly the ""little brother"" of Germany and Japan."	"Tubanze dusigure ivyo Ubutaliyano bwari bugamije. Ahanini bwari bumeze nka ""mutoyi"" w'Ubudagi n'Ubuyapani."
It had a weaker army and a weaker navy, although they had just built four new ships right before the beginning of the war.	Igisoda cabwo co hasi n'ico mu mazi nticari gikomoye, naho bari baherutse kwubaka amato ane imbere y'uko intambara itangura.
Italy's main goals were African countries. To capture those countries, they would need to have a troop launching pad, so as troops could sail across the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.	Ubutaliyano bwari bugamije ahanini ibihugu vyo muri Afrika. Kugira bubifate, bokeneye kuba bafise ahantu inteko zitera zivuye, kugira zijabuke Ikiyaga Mediterane maze zitere Afrika.
For that, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt. Besides those actions, Italy's battleships were not supposed to do anything else.	Bari bakeneye rero gukuraho ibirindiro vy'Abongereza n'amato yabwo vyari mu Misiri. Ivyo gusa ni vyo amato y'intambara y'Ubutaliyano yasabwa gukora.
Now for Japan. Japan was an island country, just like Britain.	Nayo Ubuyapani, igihugu cabwo cari kigizwe n'izinga cokimwe n'Ubwongereza.
Submarines are ships designed to travel underwater, and remain there for an extended amount of time.	Sous-marins ni amato yakorewe guca munsi y'amazi, akagumayo igihe kirekire.
Submarines were used in World War I and World War II. Back then they were very slow and had a very limited shooting range.	Amato aca munsi y'amazi yarakoreshejwe mu Ntambara ya mbere y'isi yose no mu ya kabiri. Ico gihe, yagenda bukebuke cane kandi ntiyarasa kure rwose.
In the beginning of the war they mostly travelled on top of the sea, but as radar began developing and becoming more accurate the submarines were forced to go under water to avoid being seen.	Mu ntango z'iyo ntambara, ayo mato yagendera ahanini hejuru y'amazi, mugabo aho ubuhinga bwitwa radar butanguriye gutunganwa no kuryohorwa, ayo mato yaciye abwirizwa kuza arandera munsi y'amazi kugira ntabonwe.
German submarines were called U-Boats. The Germans were very good at navigating and operating their submarines.	Amato y'Abadagi agendera munsi y'amazi yiswe U-Boats. Abadagi bari bazi rwose kunyonga no gukoresha ayo mato yabo.
Because of their success with submarines, after the war Germans aren't trusted to have many of them.	Kubera ko bazi cane ivy'amato agendera munsi y'amazi, inyuma y'intambara Abadagi ntibacizerwa cane kubona bafise mwene ayo mato menshi.
"Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as ""King Tut"" or ""The Boy King"", is one of the most well known ancient Egyptian kings in modern times."	"Ego cane! Umwami Tutanikamoni, uwuhora yitwa rimwe na rimwe yitwa ""Umwami Tut"" canke ""Umwami akiri umwana"", ni umwe mu bami ba kera bo mu Misiri bazwi cane mu bihe vya none."
Interestingly, he was not considered to be very important in ancient times and was not recorded on most ancient king lists.	Igitangaje, kera ntiyabonwa ko ahambaye cane kandi ku ntonde nyinshi z'abami ba kera ntiyanditswemwo.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many tombs of the past were robbed, this tomb was left virtually undisturbed.	Ariko aho imva yiwe yuburiwe mu 1922, yaciye amenyekana cane. Izindi mva nynshi za kera zarasahuwe, mugabo iyiwe nta kintu kinini yabaye.
Most of the items buried with Tutankhamun have been well preserved, including thousands of artefacts made from precious metals and rare stones.	Vyinshi mu bintu Toutankamon yahambanywe vyarazigamwe neza, harimwo n'utugenegene ibihumbi dukozwe mu butare bw'agaciro n'amabuye y'imbonekarimwe.
The invention of spoke wheels made Assyrian chariots lighter, faster, and better prepared to outrun soldiers and other chariots.	Igihe amapine afise ibimeze nk'amasera yatanguzwa, vyatumye imikogote y'Abashuri ihwahuka, inyaruka cane, ku buryo ishobora gusiga abandi basoda n'iyindi mikogote.
Arrows from their deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of rival soldiers. About 1000 B.C., the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.	Imyampi barasisha imiheto yica imeze bukoho yarashobora kumena ibirwanisho vy'umusoda w'umwansi. Nko mu 1000 Imbere ya Kristu, Abashuri baratanguye gukoresha igisoda c'amafarasi.
A cavalry is an army that fights on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of their horses.	Igisoda c'amafarasi kiba kigizwe n'abarwanira ku mafarasi. Kubera ko ivyo basasa ku mafarasi bitari bwabeho, abo basoda b'Abashuri barwana bicaye gusa ku migongo y'amafarasi yabo.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists, and artists. Possibly the most known person of this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet, who composed two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems Iliad and Odyssey.	Turazi Abagiriki benshi b'abanyapolitike, b'abahinga n'abahinga mu vy'utugenegene. Umwe muri bo azwi kuruta abandi ashobora kuba ari Homère, wa mwanditsi w'ivyese azwi cane w'impumyi yatunganije ivyese bibiri bikomeye cane mu vyanditswe n'Abagiriki: icese citwa Iliade n'icitwa Odyssée.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights and their plays are considered to be among the greatest works of world literature.	Sophocle na Aristophane baracari abanditsi b'ibikino bemerwa cane kandi ibikino banditse biri mu gitigiri c'ivyandikano vyemerwa kuruta ibindi vyose kw'isi.
Another famous Greek is a mathematician Pythagoras, mostly known for his famous theorem about relations of the sides of right triangles.	Uwundi Mugiriki rurangiranwa ni wa muhinga mu biharuro Pythagore, azwi canecane kubera iciyumviro yashitseko kijanye n'amasano ari hagati y'impande z'inyabutatu y'imfuruka ngororotsi.
There are varying estimates for how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated to be between the second and fourth most commonly spoken language in the world.	Hari ibitigiri ngereranyo bitandukanye bitangwa vy'abavuga igihindi uko bangana. Vyiyumvirwa ko rwoba ari ururimi rugira kabiri, gatatu canke kane ruvugwa cane kw'isi.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether or not very closely related dialects are counted.	Igitigiri c'imvukira ziruvuga kivana n'uko umuntu yoba aharuye n'abavuga indimirimi bifitaniye isano cane.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, and as many as 800 million people can understand the language.	Ibiharuro ngereranyo bivuga ko ruvugwa n'abari hagati y'imiliyoni 340 na 500 kandi ko abashika imiliyoni 800 barutahura.
Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary but different in script; in everyday conversations, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.	Igihindi n'urwitwa Urdu bifise amajambo aja gusa mugabo indome ziratandukanye. Mu biyago vya misi yose, abavuga izo ndimi zibiri usanga kenshi bumvikana.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was under great cultural influence of Germany.	Amaja mu kinjana ca 15, akarere ko mu buraruko bwa Esitoniya kisunga cane imico y'Abadagi.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the native people, so they invented the Estonian literal language.	Abafurera bamwebamwe b'Abadagi baratanguje inyandiko y'ikinya-esitoniya kugira bafashe imvukira zaho kurushiriza kumenya Imana.
"It was based on the German alphabet and one character ""Õ/õ"" was added."	"Bakoresheje indome z'ikidagi, bongerako urudome ""Õ/õ""."
As time passed, many words that were borrowed from German coalesced. This was the beginning of enlightenment.	Uko igihe cahaciye, amajambo menshi yatiwe mu kidagi yaranywanye n'urwo rurimi. Umuco wari ugiye waboneka.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne would go straight into the military after finishing school.	Mu bisanzwe samuragwa w'ubwami yaca ubwo nyene aja mu gisoda akirangiza amashure.
However, Charles went to university at Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied Anthropology and Archaeology, and later History, earning a 2:2 (a lower second class degree).	Ariko Karoli we yaciye aja kuri kaminuza yitwa Trinity College, i Cambridge, aho yize ivyerekeye imico n'imigenzo y'abantu hamwe n'ibijanye n'ibisigira vya kera, mu nyuma yiga ivya kahise, aronka urupapuro rwitwa 2:2 (ruhabwa abaronse kw'ijana).
Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree.	Karoli yabaye uwa mbere mu bo mu nda y'ingoma y'Ubwongereza yaronse urupapuro rw'umutsindo.
European Turkey (eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan peninsula) includes 3% of the country.	Tirikiya y'i Buraya (ubuseruko bwa Thrace canke Roumélie mu karere kitwa les Balkans) igize ibice 3 kw'ijana vy'ico gihugu.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape.	Akarere ka Tirikiya gafise uburebure bw'ibilometero birenga 1.600 (mayiri 1.000) n'ubwaguke bw'ibilometero 800 (mayiri 500), kakaba kagomba kumera nk'urukiramende.
Turkey's area, including lakes, occupies 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 sq mi) are in south west Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 sq mi) in Europe.	Akarere ka Tirikiya, ushizemwo n'ibiyaga, kangana n'ibilometero kwadarato 783.562 (mayiri kwadarato 300.948), ibilometero kwadarato 755.688 (mayiri kwadarato 291.773) muri vyo bikaba biri mu bumanuko bushira ubumanuko bwa Aziya, ibilometero kwadarato 23.764 (mayiri kwadarato 9.174) na vyo bikaba i Buraya.
Turkey's area makes it the world's 37th-largest country, and is about the size of Metropolitan France and the United Kingdom combined.	Uravye ingene Tirikiya ingana, ni co gihugu kigira 37 kw'isi mu bunini, kikaba kigomba kungana n'akarere nyamukuru k'Ubufaransa n'aka Royaume-Uni ubifatiye hamwe.
Turkey is encircled by seas on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.	Tirikiya ikikujwe n'ibiyaga impande zitatu: Ikiyaga Égée mu burengero, Ikiyaga c'Umunyu mu buraruko, n'Ikiyaga Mediterane mu bumanuko.
Luxembourg has a long history but its independence dates from 1839.	Luxembourg ifise kahise karere mugabo yikukiye mu 1839.
Present-day parts of Belgium were part of Luxembourg in the past but became Belgian after the 1830s Belgian Revolution.	Hari ibice vy'Ububiligi vyahora vyegukira Luxembourg. Vyegukiye Ububiligi inyuma y'Imigumuko yo mu Bubiligi yabaye mu 1830.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country but it was occupied in both World War I and World War II by Germany.	Igihugu ca Luxembourg camye kigerageza kwirinda guhengama mu vya politike mugabo carigaruriwe n'Ubudagi mu Ntambara ya mbere y'isi yose n'iya kabiri.
In 1957 Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization which is today known as the European Union.	Mu 1957, Luxembourg yabaye kimwe mu bihugu vyatanguje ishirahamwe ubu ryitwa Ishirahamwe ry'Abanyaburaya.
The Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined fortress and Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the Paro District (in Phondey Village).	Drukgyal Dzong ni inyubakwa ishaje yahoze ikomeye ikaba n'ikigo c'abihebeyimana b'Ababuda iri mu gice co haruguru c'intara ya Paro (mu kigwati ca Phondey).
It is said that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created the fortress to commemorate his victory against the Tibetan-Mongol forces.	Bivugwa ko mu 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel yubakishije iyo nyubakwa ikomeye ngo ibe icibutso c'ingene yatsinze ingabo z'Abanyatibe n'Abamongoli.
In 1951, a fire caused for only some of the relics of the Drukgyal Dzong to remain, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.	Mu 1951, umuriro waradutse utuma hasigara gusa ibisigarira bikeyi vy'iyo nyubakwa ya Drukgyal Dzong, nk'igishusho ca Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected, remaining to be one of Bhutan's most sensational attractions.	Inyuma y'uwo muriro, iyo nyubakwa yarazigamwe irakingirwa, isigara ari kimwe mu bintu vy'i Bhutan bikwega cane ingezi.
During the 18th century Cambodia found itself squeezed between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.	Mu kinjana ca 18, igihugu ca Kamboje cugaraniwe hagati y'ibihugu bibanyi bibiri bikomeye: Tayilande na Viyetinamu.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.	Abanyatayilande barateye Kamboje incuro nka zingahe mu kinjana ca 18, mu 1772 basambura Phnom Phen.
In the last years of the 18th century the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.	Mu myaka ya nyuma yo mu kinjana ca 18, Abanyaviyetinamu na bo nyene barateye Kamboje.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those who are employed work in the informal economy.	Ibice cumi n'umunani kw'ijana vy'Abanyavenezuwela nta kazi bagira, kandi benshi mu bafise akazi bikorera utwabo.
Two thirds of Venezuelans who work do so in the service sector, nearly a quarter work in industry and a fifth work in agriculture.	Bibiri vya bitatu vy'Abanyavenezuwela bafise akazi usanga bakorera abandi amaserevisi, hafi ica kane bagakorera mu mahinguriro, ica gatanu bagakora ivy'uburimyi.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil, where the country is a net exporter, even though only one percent work in the oil industry.	Ihinguriro ry'igitoro rirahambaye cane muri Venezuwela. Kirashora hanze igitoro cinshi naho igice kimwe kw'ijana gusa ari bo bakorera mu vy'igitoro.
Early in the nation's independence, Singapore Botanic Gardens' expertise helped to transform the island into a tropical Garden City.	Mu ntango z'ukwikukira kwa Singapuru, ubuhinga bwakoreshejwe muri ubwo busitani bwitwa Singapore Botanic Gardens bwarafashije guhindura iryo zinga, risigara rimeze nk'igisagara c'ubusitani co mu karere gashushe.
In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, an orchid hybrid, was chosen as the nation's national flower.	Mu 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, ishurwe ry'uruvange ryo mu bwoko bwa orchidée, ryaratowe ngo ribe ikimenyetso c'igihugu.
Every year around October nearly 1.5 million herbivores travel towards the southern plains, crossing the Mara River, from the northern hills for the rains.	Buri mwaka nko muri Gitugutu, ibikoko hafi umuliyoni 1,5 birisha birajabuka uruzi Mara bikaja mu biyaya vyo mu bumanuko bivuye mu mirambi yo mu buraruko, bigiye kurondera imvura.
And then back to the north through the west, once again crossing the Mara river, after the rains in around April.	Biraheza bikagaruka mu buraruko biciye mu buseruko, bigasubira kujabuka uruzi Mara, inyuma y'imvura y'amaja muri Ndamukiza.
The Serengeti region contains the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.	Intara ya Serengeti irimwo Pariki y'igihugu ya Serengeti, ahitwa Ngorongoro Conservation Area, ahitwa Maswa Game Reserve muri Tanzaniya be n'ahitwa Maasai Mara National Reserve muri Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools mastered in interactive classes (storyboarding, audio and video editing, story telling, etc.)	Kumenya gutunganya ibikoresho ntangamakuru bikorana na nyene kubikoresha bisaba ubuhinga busanzwe n'ubundi buhinga umuntu yigishwa gukoresha neza (gushushanya, gutunganya neza amajwi n'amasanamu, kwigana inkuru, n'ibindi.)
Interactive design requires that you re-assess your assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non-linear ways.	Gutunganya ibikoresho ntangamakuru bikorana n'ababikoresha bisaba gusuzuma ivyiyumviro usanganywe ku bijanye n'ingene ibikoresho ntangamakuru bitunganywa, ukiga kwiyumvira mu bundi butazitiye.
Interactive design requires that components of a project connect to each other, but also make sense as a separate entity.	Gutunganya mwene ivyo bikoresho bisaba ko ibihimba bigize ico kintu bihuza, ariko kimwekimwe ukwaco kikaba cikwije.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and number of lens elements required to achieve a range of focal lengths is much greater than for prime lenses.	Ingorane y'imbone igagamishwa y'icuma gifotora ni uko kugira ushobore gukwega neza ishusho ku ngero zitandukanye, bisaba ubuhinga burebure bw'imbone n'igitigiri kanaka cazo. Ku mbone zitagagamishwa biroroshe gusumba.
This is becoming less of an issue as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production.	Ariko ico kibazo kiriko kirakemurwa kuko haguma hahingurwa imbone z'ivyuma bifotora zihanitse gusumba.
This has allowed zoom lenses to produce pictures of a quality comparable to that achieved by lenses with fixed focal length.	Ivyo bituma imbone zigagamishwa zishobora gusohora amafoto meza nk'ayaboneka iyo hakoreshejwe imbone zitagagamishwa.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (the speed) of the lens is usually lower.	Iyindi ngorane y'imbone zigagamishwa ni uko ukwuguruka kwazo kwuzuye (ubunyarutsi) gukunze kuba guto.
This makes inexpensive zoom lenses hard to use in low-light conditions without a flash.	Ivyo bituma imbone zigagamishwa zizimbutse zigorana gukoresha ahari umuco muke udafise flash.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a movie to DVD format is the overscan.	Imwe mu ngorane zikunda gushika iyo uriko uragerageza guhindura ireresi ngo ije mu mero ya DVD ni ovasikane.
Most televisions are made in a way to please the general public.	Imboneshakure nyinshi zikozwe kugira zinezereze abantu muri rusangi.
For that reason, everything you see on the TV had the borders cut, top, bottom and sides.	Ku bw’iyo mvo, ku mpera y'amasanamu yose ubona ku mboneshakure harakaswe, hejuru, hasi, no ku mpande.
This is made to ensure that the image covers the whole screen. That is called overscan.	Ibi bikorwa kugira ngo isanamu ikwire ekara yose. Ibi vyitwa ovasikane.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, it's borders will most likely be cut too, and if the video had subtitles too close to the bottom, they won't be fully shown.	Ikibabaje, iyo ukoze DVD, impera zayo kenshi ziba zikase na zo nyene, kandi igihe iyo reresi ifise amajambo yanditswemwo ayisigura yegereye cane hasi, ntaba akibonetse yose.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination, conjuring up images of jousts, banquets and Arthurian chivalry.	Abantu bamye biyumvira vyinshi ku nzu nini za kera z’ibihome bikomeye zubatswe hagati y'ikinjana ca gatanu n'impera z'ikinjana ca cumi na gatanu, bakabona mu bwenge amahiganwa yaba yo kugwanira ku mafarasi, imfungurwa basangirira hamwe ari benshi, hamwe n'igisoda c'intwari ca Arthur.
Even standing amidst thousand year-old ruins it is easy to bring to mind the sounds and smells of battles long gone, to almost hear the clatter of hooves on the cobbles and to smell the fear rising from the dungeon pits.	Naho woba uhagaze gusa mu bisigarira bimaze imyaka igihumbi, biroroshe kwiha ishusho y’intambara zabaye kera, ukumva imigere y’amafarasi n’ubwoba bw’abafungiwe mu busho buhishije cane.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?	Ariko burya vyoba vyari nk'uko tuvyiyumvira? Ni kuki inzu nini z’ibihome bikomeye zubatswe? Imigero yazo yari imeze gute, kandi zubakwa gute?
Typical for the period, Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a fortified house than a true castle.	Cokimwe n'izindi shato z'ico gihe, Shato y'i Kirby Muxloe si shato nyayo ahubwo isa cane n'inyubakwa ikingijwe ibikuta.
Its large glazed windows and thin walls would not have been able to resist a determined attack for long.	Amadirisha yayo akayangana n'impome zayo zonze ntivyari kurinda ibitero bikaze ikiringo kirekire.
In the 1480s, when its construction was begun by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful and defense was only required against small bands of roving marauders.	Igihe Umutware Hastings yarangura kuyubaka mu myaka ya 1480, igihugu cari gifise amahoro ku rugero runaka, kandi bakenera gusa kwivuna utugwi tw'abasuma twigenza.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states.	Ukurimbanya ubutegetsi bwari uburyo ibihugu vy'i Buraya bwakoresheje kugira kimwe cose muri vyo kigumane ubwigenge bwaco.
The concept was that all European nations had to seek to prevent one nation from becoming powerful, and thus national governments often changed their alliances in order to maintain the balance.	Iciyumviro cari ic'uko ibihugu vyose vy'i Buraya vyategerezwa kubuza igihugu kimwe gukomera birenze. Ni co gituma intwaro zaho zakunda guhindura inani zagiranye kugira ntihabe ubusumbane.
The War of Spanish Succession marked the first war whose central issue was the balance of power.	Intambara yiswe guerre de Succession d'Espagne yabaye intambara ya mbere ijanye n'ico kibazo co kurimbanya ubutegetsi.
This marked an important change, as European powers would no longer have the pretext of being religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be labeled a religious war.	Ryari ihinduka rikomeye kubera ko ico gihe ibihugu bikomeye vy'i Buraya bitosubiye kurwana vyitwaje idini. Ya Ntambara y'imyaka mirongo itatu yobaye yo ntambara ya nyuma yitirirwa idini.
The temple of Artemis at Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BCE in an act of arson committed by Herostratus.	Urusengero rwa Artemis rw'i Efeso rwasambutse ku wa 21 Mukakaro 356 M.K. ruturiwe nkana na Érostrate.
According to the story, his motivation was fame at any cost. The Ephesians, outraged, announced that Herostratus' name never be recorded.	Bivugwa ko yarondera kumenyekana vyanka vyakunda. Abanyefeso bararatse, baca batangaza ko izina rya Érostrate ridakwiye kwigera ryandikwa.
The Greek historian Strabo later noted the name, which is how we know today. The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born.	Strabon, umuhinga mu vya kahise w'Umugiriki, yahavuye yandika iryo zina, ari co gituma turizi uyu musi. Urwo rusengero rwaturiwe ijoro nyene Alegizandere Mukuru yavuka.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay to rebuild the temple, but his offer was denied. Later, after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE.	Alegizandere amaze kuba umwami yaripfuje gusanura urwo rusengero, baramwankira. Rwahavuye rusanurwa mu 323 M.K. amaze gupfa.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while still hitting all the notes correctly - also try not to make much extraneous motion with your fingers.	Raba neza ko intoke zahwe zorohewe igihe ufyonda ayo manota yose, kandi ugerageze kudakoresha cane intoke zawe ibidakenewe.
This way, you will tire yourself out as little as possible. Remember there's no need to hit the keys with a lot of force for extra volume like on the piano.	Gutyo ntuzoruha cane. Wibuke ko bidakenewe yuko ufyonda amanota n'inguvu kugira avuge cane nka kurya bigenda kuri piyano.
On the accordion, to get extra volume, you use the bellows with more pressure or speed.	Kugira inota rivuge cane ku kinanda, ukoresha igisaho caco n'inguvu canke unyarutsa.
Mysticism is the pursuit of communion with, identity with, or conscious awareness of an ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.	Ukunywana n'Imana ni ukugerageza kwiyeregeza ikibirengeye, ikimana, ukuri kw'ivy'impwemu canke Imana, kuyiyumvamwo canke kuyitahura.
The believer seeks a direct experience, intuition, or insight into divine reality/the deity or dieties.	Uwemera aba arondera ukubibabamwo, ugutahura, canke ubumenyi mu kuri ku bijanye n´Imana/ ikigirwamana canke ibigirwamana.
Followers pursue certain ways of living, or practices that are intended to nurture those experiences.	Abayoboke bakwirikirana inzira zizwi zo kubaho, canke imigenzo igenewe gukomeza ivyo babayemwo.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship by its emphasis on the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, particularly those of a peaceful, insightful, blissful, or even ecstatic character.	Ukwemera ibisigabwenge bishobora gutandukanwa n´ukundi kwemera kw´amadini canke ugusenga biciye ku kuntu kwibanda mu vyo umuntu yabayemwo mu gihe yaba mu bihe bitangaje, na cane cane ku bantu b´abanyamahoro, bafise ubumenyi bwinshi, babayeho banezerewe, canke bafise kamere yo kunezerwa cane.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian sub-continent. It originated in the Punjab region during the 15th century from a sectarian split within the Hindu tradition.	Sikhisme n'idini ryo m'Ubuhindi bwo mu bumanuko. Ryakomotse mu karere ka Punjab mu kinjana ca 15 bitewe n'ukwiyonkora kw'imihari kwo mu migenzo y'Aba Hindu.
Sikhs consider their faith to be a separate religion from Hinduism though they acknowledge its Hindu roots and traditions.	Aba Sikhs bafata nk'aho ukwemera kwabo ari idini ritandukanye n'irya Hinduisme n'aho babizi neza ko gufise imizi n'imigenzo ya gi Hindu.
"Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which is Punjabi for ""way of the guru"". The guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions but in Sikhism has taken on an importance that forms the core of Sikh beliefs."	"Aba Sikhs bita ishengero ryabo Gurmat, n'igi Punjab gisigura ngo ""inzira y'umwigisha mukuru"". Umwigisha mukuru ni ngombwa bidasanzwe mu madini yose y'Abahindi ariko muri Sikhisme agira akamaro kagena imizi y'ukwemera kw'aba Sikhs."
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469–1539). There followed in succession a further nine gurus.	Iryo dini ryatangujwe mu kinjana ca 15 n'umwigisha mukuru Nanak (1469-1539). Hakwirikiye abigisha bakuru icenda bagiye bakurakuranwa.
However, in June 1956, Krushchev's promises were put to the test when riots in Poland, where workers were protesting against food shortages and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against Communism.	N'aho biri ukwo, muri Ruheshi 1956, ivyo Krushchev yiyemeje vyarapimwe aho imigumuko muri Pologne, aho abakozi bariko biyamiriza ubukene bw'imfungurwa n'ukugabanuka kw'imishahara, bahindukira bakiyamiririza hamwe Communisme.
Although in the end, Krushchev sent in tanks to restore order, he did give way to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.	Ariko mu mpera, Krushchev yarungitse amaburende kugira agarukane umutekano, yaremeye bimwe mu vyo basaba ku mafaranga kandi yemera kugena uwushigikiwe cane Wladyslaw Gomulka nk'icegera cambere.
The Indus Valley Civilization was a Bronze Age civilisation in the northwest Indian subcontinent encompassing most of modern-day Pakistan and some regions in northwest India and northeast Afghanistan.	Ibisagara vyo mu kabande ka Indus Valley vyari ibisagara vyo mu bihe vya Bronze mu buraruko bushira uburengero bwo m'Ubuhindi bwa ruguru harimwo Pakistani y'ubu n'uturere tumwe tumwe mu buraruko bushira uburengero bw'Ubuhindi no mu buraruko bushira ubuseruko bwa Afuganistani.
The civilisation flourished in the basins of the Indus River wherefore it derives its name.	Ico gisagara vyaratagase mu biyaya vy'uruzi Indus ari naho gikura izina ryaco.
Although some scholars speculate that since the civilisation also existed in the basins of the now dried up Sarasvati River, it should be aptly called the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization, while some call it the Harappan Civilization after Harappa, the first of its sites to be excavated in the 1920s.	N'aho abanyeshure bamwe bahitishamwo ngo kuva ico gisagara carabayeho no mu biyaya vy'uruzi rusigaye rwarakamye rwa Sarasvati, cabwirizwa kwitwa neza na neza igisagara ca Indus-Sarasvati, mu gihe bamwe bacita igisagara ca Harappan bisunze Harappa, kimwe mu bibanza vyaho vyambere vyatanguye gucukurwa mu za 1920.
The militaristic nature of the Roman empire aided in the development of medical advances.	Kamere ya Gisirikare y'ubwami bw'aba Romani karafashije mw'iterambere ry'ukuduga kw'ubuganga.
Doctors began to be recruited by Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman Medical Corps for use in the aftermath of battles.	Abaganga batanguye guhabwa akazi n'Umwami w'abami Augustus maze banashiraho umugwi wambere w'Abaganga b'Abaromani bo kuvura abantu inyuma y'intambara.
Surgeons had knowledge of various sedatives including morphine from extracts of poppy seeds and scopolamine from herbane seeds.	Abaganga babaga bari bafise ubumenyi bw'ibisinziriza vyinshi harimwo na morphine ikorwa mu ntete ziturika na scopolamine iva mu ntete z'ivyatsi.
They became proficient at amputation to save patients from gangrene as well as tourniquets and arterial clamps to stem blood flow.	Baranonosoye ugukata ibihimba kugira bakingire abagwayi ibora ry'ibisebe hamwe n'ivy'ibikoresho bizibira imitsi bikabuza amaraso kuva.
Over multiple centuries, the Roman empire led to great gains in the field of medicine and formed much of the knowledge we know today.	Mu gihe c'ibinjana vyinshi, ubwami bw'Abaromani bwatumye haba inyungu nyinshin mu bijanye n'ubuganga kandi habaho ubumenyi dufise uyu musi.
Pureland origami is origami with the restriction that only one fold may be done at a time, more complex folds like reverse folds are not allowed, and all folds have straightforward locations.	Origami ya Pureland ni origami ifise itegeko y'uko ushobora kuzinga rimwe gusa buri gihe, kuzinga mu buryo buyobeye nko kuzinga uhereye inyuma ntibirekuwe, kandi imizingo yose ikorwa mu buryo butumbereye.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced folders or those with limited motor skills.	Origami ya Pureland ni origami ifise itegeko y'uko ushobora kuzinga rimwe gusa buri gihe, kuzinga mu buryo buyobeye nko kuzinga uhereye inyuma ntibirekuwe, kandi imizingo yose ikorwa mu buryo butumbereye.
Children develop an awareness of race and racial stereotypes quite young and these racial stereotypes affect behavior.	Abana biga kubona ubwoko n'itandukaniro rifatiye ku moko bakiri bato kandi iryo tandukanya rifatiye ku moko ritagira ingaruko ku kuntu bitwara.
For instance, children who identify with a racial minority that is stereotyped as not doing well in school tend to not do well in school once they learn about the stereotype associated with their race.	Nk'akarorero, abana bibona ko ari abo mu bwoko bw'inkehwa bubonwa nk'aho budakora neza kw'ishure bahakwa kudakora neza mw'ishure mu gihe bamaze kumenya ukwo kuntu bavugwa mu bwoko bwabo.
MySpace is the third most popular website used in the United States and has 54 million profiles currently.	MySpace ni urubuga rugira gatatu mu mbuga ngurukanabumenyi zikundwa n’abantu benshi zikoreshwa muri Leta Zunze Ubumwe za Amerika kandi ruriko imyidondoro y'abantu imiriyoni 54 muri kano kanya.
These websites have gotten a lot of attention, especially in the education setting.	Izi mbuga ngurukanabumenyi zirakurikirwa cane, na canecane mu gisata c’indero.
There are positive aspects to these websites, which include, being able to easily setup a class page which can include blogs, videos, photos, and other features.	Hariho ibintu vyiza biranga izo mbuga ngurukanabumenyi, harimwo gushobora gushiraho vyoroshe urubuga rw'ishure rushobora kubamwo ama blog, amareresi, amasanamu, hamwe n’ibindi bintu.
This page can easily be accessed by providing just one web address, which makes it easy to remember and easy to type in for students who may have trouble using the keyboard or with spelling.	Uru rubuga rurashobora gushikwako vyoroshe mu gutanga inzira y'umuhora ngurukanabumenyi imwe gusa, bigatuma woroha kwibuka no kwandika ku banyeshure bashobora kuba bafise ingorane yo gukoresha icandikisho c’inyabwonko canke yo gutondeka neza indome zigize ijambo.
It can be customized to make it easy to read and also with as much or little color as desired.	Urashobora kuruhinyanyura kugira vyorohe gusoma ibiriko, ugashiramwo amabara menshi canke make nk'uko uvyipfuza.
"Attention Deficit Disorder ""is a neurological syndrome whose classic defining triad of symptoms including impulsivity, distractibility, and hyperactivity or excess energy""."	"Ingwara yo Gusamara Cane ""ni ingwara yo mu bwenge ifise inyabutatu y'ibimenyetso biyiranga birimwo uguhubuka, ugutwarwa n'ukutaguma hamwe canke ukugira umwete urengeje""."
"It is not a learning disability, it is a learning disorder; it ""affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps as many as 2 million American children""."	"Si ubumuga mu bijanye no kwiga, ni ingorane mu vyo kwiga; ""ishikira 3 canke 5 kw'ijana mu bana bose, kumbure abashika nk'imiliyoni 2 z'abana b'Abanyamerika""."
Children with ADD have a hard time focusing on things like school work, but they can concentrate on things they enjoy doing like playing games or watching their favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation.	Abana bafise ingorane ya ADD bafise ibibazo vyo kugumiza umutima ku bintu nk'ibikorwa vy'ishure, ariko bashobora kugumiza umutima ku bintu baryohererwa gukora nko gukina inkino canke kuraba desanime canke kwandika amajambo ata dukwabu.
"These children tend to get into a lot of trouble, because they ""engage in risky behaviors, get into fights, and challenge authority"" in order to stimulate their brain, since their brain can not be stimulated by normal methods."	"Abo bana bameze nk'abama mu bibazo vyinshi, kuko ""baja mu bintu birimwo ingorane, bararwana, kandi ntibatinye ababakurira"" kugira bakabure ubwonko bwabo, kuko ubwonko bwabo budashobora gukaburwa n'uburyo busanzwe."
ADD affects relationships with other peers because other children can not understand why they act the way that they do or why they spell they way they do or that their maturity level is different.	Ingorane ya ADD iragira ingaruka ku migenderanire n'urundi runganwe kuko abandi bana ntibashobora gutahura igituma bigenza nk'ukwo canke igituma bandika ukwo canke bakavuga ngo urugero rwo guca akenge rwabo ruratandukanye.
As the ability to obtain knowledge and to learn changed in such a way as mentioned above the base rate at which knowledge was obtained changed.	kuko ubushobozi bwo kuronka ubumenyi no kwiga bwahindutse mu buryo nka burya bwerekanwe aha hejuru, igipimo c'intango ubumenyi buronkerwako carahindutse.
The approach to obtaining information was different. No longer did pressure reside within individual recall, but the ability to recall text became more of a focus.	Inzira yo kuronka amakuru yari itandukanye. Akamaro ntikari kakiri mu bushobozi bw'umuntu bwo kwibuka, ahubwo ubushobozi bwo kwibuka ivyanditse bwabaye ubwisungwa.
In essence, the Renaissance made a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.	Mu bisanzwe, Renaissance yagize impinduka idasanzwe mu nzira zo kwiga n'uguhanahana ubumenyi.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands in locomotion or bearing weight or swinging through the trees.	Atari nk'izindi nkende, abantu ntibagikoresha amaboko yabo mu kugenda canke guterura ibiro vyabo canke mu kwenena mu biti.
The chimpanzee's hand and foot are similar in size and length, reflecting the hand's use for bearing weight in knuckle walking.	Ukuboko kw'inguge n'ikirenge cayo birasa mu bunini no mu bwaguke, bikerekana igikorwa c'ukwo kuboko co kurerura uburemere bwayo no mu guhonyora ku nkoshi z'intoki.
The human hand is shorter than the foot, with straighter phalanges.	Ukuboko kw'umuntu ni kugufi kuruta ikirenge, n'amagufa yo mu kiganza agoroye.
Fossil hand bones two million to three million years old reveal this shift in specialization of the hand from locomotion to manipulation.	Amagufa yo mu kuboko yacitse amabuye amaze imyaka imiliyoni nka zibiri gushika kuri zitatu arerekana iri hinduka mu gikorwa c'ukuboko kuva mu vyo kugendagenda kukaja muvyo gukora ibintu.
Some people believe that experiencing many artificially induced lucid dreams often enough can be very exhausting.	Abantu bamwe bamwe barizera ko kuronka indoto ukanura ziterwa n'uko wabiteguye bishobora kenshi kukuruhisha cane.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of the lucid dreams expanding the length of time between REM states.	Imvo nyamukuru y'iki kintu ni ibiba vyatewe n'izo ndoto ugira ukanura ziba zatewe n'uburebure bw'umwanya ijisho rikanaguzwa wa REM.
With fewer REMs per night, this state in which you experience actual sleep and your body recovers becomes infrequent enough to become a problem.	Habaye ugukanaguzwa kwa REM guke kw'amaso mw'ijro, ukwo kuntu uba umeze iyo uri mw'itiro kandi uko umubiri wawe ukanguka bica bitangura guhindagurika ivyo bikaba bikwiye kugira bibe ikibazo.
This is just as exhausting as if you were to wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV.	Ibi biraruhisha cane nk'aho woba uriko uravyuka buri minota mirongo ibiri canke mirongo itatu ukaraba imboneshakure.
The effect is dependent on how often your brain attempts to lucidly dream per night.	Ibiba bivana n'incuro ubwonko bwawe bugerageza kurota ukanura mw'ijoro.
Things did not go well for the Italians in North Africa almost from the start. Within a week of Italy's declaration of war on June 10, 1940, the British 11th Hussars had seized Fort Capuzzo in Libya.	"Ibintu ntivyigeze bigendera neza Abatariyano muri Afirika yo mu buraruko kuva nko mu ntango. Inyuma y’indwi imwe Ubutariyano bumaze kumenyesha ko butanguje intambara kw’itariki 10 Ruheshi 1940, ingabo z’Abongereza zitwa ""11e régiment de hussards"" zari zafashe iboma Kapuzo muri Libiya."
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the Italian Tenth Army's Engineer-in-Chief, General Lastucci.	Mu mutego wo mu buseruko bwa Baridiya, Abongereza barafashe enjeniyeri mukuru w’Ikambi y’icumi y’igisoda c’Ubutariyano, Jenerari Rasituci.
On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, the Governor-General of Libya and apparent heir to Mussolini, was killed by friendly fire while landing in Tobruk.	Itariki 28 Ruheshi, Mareshale Itaro Balbo, uwari asanzwe ari umuserukizi mukuru w’ubwami muri Libiya akongera akabonwa na benshi nka samuragwa wa Musorini, yararashwe bamwihenzeko mu gihe yari ashitse i Toburuki.
The modern sport of fencing is played at many levels, from students learning at a university to professional and Olympic competition.	Urukino rushasha rwo kugwana hakoreshejwe inkota zitozito rukinwa ku rugero rutandukanye, kuva ku banyeshure biga muri kaminuza kugeza ku mahiganwa y'ababigize umwuga, be no muri Olempike.
The sport is primarily played in a duel format, one fencer dueling another.	Uru rukino rukinwa n’abantu babiri babiri, aho umwe akina n’uwundi.
Golf is a game in which players use clubs to hit balls into holes.	Golf ni Urukino bakoresha udukoni mu gukupita udupira ngo twinjire mu tunogo.
Eighteen holes are played during a regular round, with players usually starting on the first hole on the course and finishing on the eighteenth.	Igice kimwe kigizwe n'imyobo cumi n’umunani. abakinyi bahera ku kanogo kambere b’injiza gushika kuka cumi n'umunani.
The player who takes the fewest strokes, or swings of the club, to complete the course wins.	Umukinyi atsinda ni uwuba yateye gake kugira yinjize.
The game is played on grass, and the grass around the hole is mown shorter and called the green.	Uru rukino rukinirwa mu vyatsi. Ivyatsi biri iruhande y’akanogo barabikata kugirango ntibizibire akanogo. Aho ako kanogo kari bakita The green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is what most people associate with traveling: Recreation tourism.	Ingendo zo kwidagagadura abantu benshi bazi ni ingendo zijanye no gutembera.
This is when people go to a place that is very different from their regular day-to-day life to relax and have fun.	Aha ni igihe abantu baja ahantu hatandukanye n’ubuzima bwabo bwa minsi yose kugirango baruhuke kandi baryoherwe.
Beaches, theme parks and camp grounds are often the most common places frequented by recreational tourists.	Inkombe z'ibiyaga, ama parike hamwe n’ibibuga vyo kuryama mwo niho hantu hakundwa cane n’abatembera bashaka kunezerwa.
If the objective of one’s visit to a particular place is to get to know its history and culture then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.	Mu gihe intumbero y’umuntu yo kuja ahantu ari ukumenya kahise n’umuco n’akaranga vyaho, ubwo bwoko bwo gutembera babwita ugutembera bijanye n’akaranga.
Tourists may visit different landmarks of a particular country or they may simply opt to focus on just one area.	Abatembera barashobora guhitamwo ahantu henshi ho kugendera mu gihugu runaka canke bagatemberera agace kamwe gusa.
The Colonists, seeing this activity, had also called for reinforcements.	Bamaze kubona ivyariko biraba, Abakoloni baciye batumako ababafasha.
Troops reinforcing the forward positions included the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments of 200 men, under Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later became generals).	Ingabo zaje gufasha zari ingabo 200 ziva mu ntara ya 1 niya 3 ya gisirikare c’i New Hampshire. Izo ngabo zari zirongowe na koroneli John Stark na James Reed (bose munyuma barabaye abajenerali).
Stark's men took positions along the fence on the north end of the Colonist's position.	Ingabo za Stark zaciye zija mu buraruko bwuruzitiro bw’umukoloni.
When low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River along the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the north ending at the water's edge on a small beach.	Igihe umwonga w’epfo wugurura intoboro ku ruzi Mystic rwo mu buraruko ishira ubuseruko br’iryo zinga, baciye bongereza uruzitiro bakoresheje amabuye. Urwo ruzitiro rwahera mu buraruko rukagarukira ku nkombe y’amazi.
Gridley or Stark placed a stake about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one fire until the regulars passed it.	Gridley canke Stark bashinze igiti ku (metero 30) imbere y’uruzitiro baca bategeka ko atamuntu n’umwe arasa kiretse abantu barenganye ico giti.
The American plan relied on launching coordinated attacks from three different directions.	Amerika yari ifise umugambi wo gutera ibitero vyerekeza ahantu hatatu hatandukanye.
General John Cadwalder would launch a diversionary attack against the British garrison at Bordentown, in order to block off any reinforcements.	Jenerali John Cadwalader yarashobora gukora igitero ku birindiro vy'ingabo z’Abongereza i Bordentown, kugira gusa abirandishe.
General James Ewing would take 700 militia across the river at Trenton Ferry, seize the bridge over the Assunpink Creek and prevent any enemy troops from escaping.	Jenerali James Ewing yari gufata abagwanyi 700 akajabuka uruzi mu gace ka Trenton Ferry, agaca acunga ikiraro cahitwa Assunpink Creek agaca acunga ntihagire umwansi arengana.
The main assault force of 2,400 men would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, in order to launch a pre-dawn attack.	Ingabo zari zikomeye zari zigizwe n’abantu 2,400. Zarajabuka uruzi nko ku bilometero bitandatu mu buraruko bwa Trenton, hanyuma zikigaburamwo kubiri, ingabo zimwe ziyobowe na Greene izindi ziyobowe na Sullivan, kugira ngobagire ibitero mu bucagucagu.
With the change from the quarter to the half mile run, speed becomes of much less importance and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.	Kubera ihinduka ryo kuva ku metero amajana ane baja ku metero amajana umunani, umuvuduko ntuba ugikenewe cane ahubwo haba hakenewe kwihangana hanyuma ukagumizako.
Of course a first-class half-miler, a man who can beat two minutes, must be possessed of a fair amount of speed, but endurance must be cultivated at all hazards.	Ego nivyo, kugira umuntu atsinde imetero amajana umunani mu minota ibiri harakenewe umuvuduko, ariko igikenewe cane cane ni kwihangana ukagumizako.
Some cross country running during the winter, combined with gymnasium work for the upper part of the body, is the best preparation for the running season.	Mu kwitegurira neza kwiruka, ni ugufata ukiruka cane mu rushana kandi ukanonora n’imitsi.
Proper nutritional practices alone cannot generate elite performances, but they can significantly affect young athletes' overall wellness.	Gufungura neza kwonyene ntigushobora kuzana ingaruka nziza, ariko birashobora kugira ingaruka zikomeye kubanonotsi bakiri bato.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, practicing effective hydration habits, and understanding the various aspects of supplementation practices can help athletes improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of the sport.	Kugumana inguvu nziza, kunywa amazi neza hamwe no gutahura uburyo butandukanye bwo kugorora imitsi, birafasha abanonotsi kuduza uko babayeho hanyuma bigatuma bakunda kwinonora imitsi.
Middle distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, there are many misconceptions regarding the few pieces of equipment required to participate.	Ukwiruka ni urukino ruzimbutse; ariko, hari abantu benshi babesha ku buryo bukenewe kugira ngo umuntu arwitabire.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most will have little or no real impact on performance.	Urashobora kugura ivyukeneye gusa, kuko s'ibikoresho bituma utsinda canke udatsinda.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even when it provides no real benefits.	Abanonotsi bashobora kwumva bashaka ikintu naho ataco vyoba vyungura.
The atom can be considered to be one of the fundamental building blocks of all matter.	Atome irashobora gufatwa nka kimwe ibintu vyose vyubakiyeko.
Its a very complex entity which consists, according to a simplified Bohr model, of a central nucleus orbited by electrons, somewhat similar to planets orbiting the sun - see Figure 1.1.	Kubwa Bohr, ibi ni n’ibintu bigoye cane bigizwe n’ingobane canke selile yo hagati ikikijwe n’ivyitwa elekitro. Bimeze nk’imibumbe izunguruka iruhande y’izuba - raba isanamu ya 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.	Iyo ngobane yitwa nucleus igizwe n’uduce tubiri: akitwa netro nakitwa proto.
Protons have a positive electric charge while neutrons have no charge. The electrons have a negative electric charge.	Izo proto zifise umuyagankuba mwiza ariko netro ntawo zifise. Elekitro zifise umuyagankuba mubi.
To Check the victim, you must first survey the scene to ensure your safety.	Kugira murabe uwahohotewe, utegerezwa kubanza kuraba irya n’ino kugira urabe neza umutekano wawe.
You need to notice the victim's position as you approach him or her and any automatic red flags.	Utegerezwa kubanza kuraba uko uwahohoteye aryamye, ameze canke ikindi kintu icarico cose imbere yo kumwegera.
If you get hurt trying to help, you may only serve to make matters worse.	Gukomereka uriko urafasha vyotuma ibintu biba nabi kurusha.
The study found that depression, fear and catastrophising mediated the relationship between pain and disability in lower back pain sufferers.	Ubushakashatsi bwerekanye ko akabonge, ubwoba hamwe no kwumva wihebuye vyahinduye isano riri hagati y’ububabare n’ubumuga ku bantu bafise ububabare bwo mu mugongo.
Only the effects of catastrophizing, not depression and fear was conditional of regular weekly structured PA sessions.	Gusa ingaruka ziterwa no kwumva wihebuye, atari izakabonge canke ubwoba, zishingiye ku nyigisho zisanzwe zijanye nivyo kugorora umubiri ziba buri ndwi.
Those participating in regular activity required more support in terms of negative perception of pain distinguishing the differences of chronic pain and discomfort feel from normal physical movement.	Abitabira mu bikorwa vya minsi yose basanze bakeneye kemenya vyinshi cane bijanye n’itandukaniro ry’ububabare bwo ku mubiri n’ubwo kutiyumva neza.
Vision, or the ability to see depends on visual system sensory organs or eyes.	Ukubona, canke ubushasha bwo kubona buva kubihimba bijejwe kuraba canke ku maso.
There are many different constructions of eyes, ranging in complexity depending on the requirements of the organism.	Hariho ibintu vyinshi bitandukanye bigize amaso, ivyo navyo bivana bigenda bigorana bivanye nico umubiri usaba.
The different constructions have different capabilities, are sensitive to different wave-lengths and have differing degrees of acuity, also they require different processing to make sense of the input and different numbers to work optimally.	Inyubako z'ijisho zifise ubushobozi butandukanye, ntizifise ububasha bumwe bwo kubona ibiri kure, kandi zisabwa ububasha butari buto kugira ngo zibone neza.
A population is the collection of organisms of a particular species within a given geographic area.	Umurwi w’ibinyabuzima ni iyegeranirizo ry’ibinyabuzima vy’ubwoko bunaka, biri mugace kanaka.
When all individuals in a population are identical with regard to a particular phenotypic trait they are known as monomorphic.	Iyo ibinyabuzima bigize umurwi vyose bisa, na cane cane uravye imforo yavyo, baca bavyita foroma imwe.
When the individuals show several variants of a particular trait they are polymorphic.	Iyo ivyo binyabuzima bifise inforo itandukanye bavyita Mudasa.
Army ant colonies march and nest in different phases as well.	Ibinyegeri vyose ntibigendana canke ngo biryame hamwe.
In the nomadic phase, army ants march at night and stop to camp during the day.	iyo buriko burimuka, ubunyegeri bugenda mwijoro hanyuma bukaryama ku murango.
The colony begins a nomadic phase when available food has decreased. During this phase, the colony makes temporary nests that are changed everyday.	Ukwimukira gutangura iyo inrya zagabanutse. Muri iki gihe, ubu bunyegeri burubaka aho burara ariko buza burahindura buri munsi.
Each of these nomadic rampages or marches lasts for approximately 17 days.	Uku kwimukira canke ingendo kumara iminsi 17.
"What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word ""cella"", meaning ""small room"", and it was first coined by a microscopist observing the structure of cork."	"Selile ni iki? Ijambo selile rikomoka mw’ijambo ry'ikilatini ""cella"""", risigura """"akumba gato"", kandi iryo jambo ryatanguwe gukoreshwa n’umuhinga yariko yiga ibice bigize igiti coroshe kivamwo imifundikizo y’amacupa cane cane y'imivinyu."
The cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.	Selile niyo tanguriro ry'ibinyabuzima vyose kandi imibiri yose irafise selile imwe canke nyinshi.
"Cells are so basic and critical to the study of life, in fact, that they are often referred to as ""the building blocks of life""."	"Selile nizo rufatiro mubijanye no kwiga ubuzima kandi ninaco gituma bazita ""ibice vyubaka ubuzima""."
The Nervous System maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through out the body to keep the flow of blood going as well as undisturbed.	Ubwonko nibwo butuma umuntu aguma abaho, mu kurungika ububasha mu mubiri wose, ivyo navyo bigatua amaraso aguma atembere atakiyabujije.
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly throughout the body which helps keep the body safe from any potential threat.	Ubwo bubasha buvuye mu bwonko buguma burungikwa ningoga mu mubiri arinaco gifasha umubiri kungirane zose zowushikira.
Tornadoes strike a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.	Ibivumbuzi bifata agace gato ugereranije n’ibihuhusi binini binini, ariko aho biciye birashobora kwonona ibintu vyinshi cane.
Tornadoes uproot trees, rip boards from buildings, and fling cars up into the sky. The most violent two percent of tornadoes last more than three hours.	Ibivumbuzi birarandura ibiti, bigakura imbaho ku mazu kandi bikagurura n’imodoka mu kirere. Ibice bibiri kw’ijana vy’ibivumbuzi bikaze bimara amasaha arenga atatu.
These monster storms have winds up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).	Ibivumbuzi bifise umuyaga ugenda ku bilometero 480 kw’isaha (133 m/s; 300 mph).
Humans have been making and using lenses for magnification for thousands and thousands of years.	Haraciye imya n’imyaka abantu bakoze, kandi bakoresha rugagamisha.
However, the first true telescopes were made in Europe in the late 16th century.	Ariko gukoresha rugagamisha z’ikirere za mbere zakorewe i burayi mu mpera z’ikinjana ca 16.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear both nearer and larger.	Izi rugagamisha zakoresha iteranywa ryamarori abiri agamisha kugirango ikintu kiri kure bakibone hafi kandi cagutse.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us and it is the nature of cooperation that when the majority benefit there will always be more to gain in the short term by acting selfishly	Ukwikunda n’ukwigungirako tuzovyamana, kandi abantu benshi baronka vyinshi iyo bakoreye hamwe. Hari abazokwama bunguka vyinshi mugihe bigungiyeko.
Hopefully, most people will realise that their long term best option is to work together with others.	Twizere ko abantu benshi bazotinda bakabona ko ari vyiza gukorana n’abandi.
Many people dream of the day when humans can travel to another star and explore other worlds, some people wonder what's out there some belive that aliens or other life may live on another plant.	Abantu benshi barota umunsi abantu bazoshobora gutembera muyindi nyenyeri bakaja kurondera izindi si, abantu bamwe bibaza ibiri hanze y'isi abandi bemeza ko hariyo abantu babanyamahanga canke ubundi buzima bushobora kuba kuyindi si.
"But, if this ever does happen probably won't happen for a very long time. The stars are so spread out that there are trillions of miles between stars that are ""neighbors""."	"Ariko, niba ibi bibaye birashoboka ko bitazosubira kuba imbere yiihe kitari gito. Inyenyeri ziratandukanye cane kuburyo hari ibilometero miriyari hagati y’inyenyeri ""zegeranye""."
Maybe one day, your great grandchildren will be standing atop an alien world wondering about their ancient ancestors?	Birashoboka ko umunsi umwe, abuzukuruza bawe bazohagarara hejuru y’isi iriko abanyamahanga bibaza abakurambere babo ba kera?
Animals are made of many cells. They eat things and digest them inside. Most animals can move.	Ibikoko bigizwe na selile nyinshi. Birarya ibintu hanyuma bikabisyera indani. Ibikoko vyinshi birashobora kwiyunguruza.
Only animals have brains (though not even all animals do; jellyfish, for example, do not have brains).	Ibikoko nivyo gusa bifise ubwonko(naho ibikoko vyose bitabufise; jellyfish, nk’akarorero ntabwonko zifise).
Animals are found all over the earth. They dig in the ground, swim in the oceans, and fly in the sky.	Ibikoko biri kw’isi yose. Birimba mu kuzimu, biroga mu biyaga, kandi bikaguruka mu kirere.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living (things) organism.	Selile ni agace gato kubatse kandi gakora mu binyamubizma bikomeye(canke mu bintu).
Cell comes from the Latin word cella which means small room.	Selile iva mw’ijambo ry'ikilatini cella risigura icumba gito.
If you look at living things under a microscope, you will see that they are made of small squares or balls.	Iyo uravye ibinyabuzima muri rugagamisha, urabona ko bikozwe n’ibintu bimeze nk’inyabune canke ibintu bimeze nk’utuzingi.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, saw small squares in cork with a microscope.	Robert Hooke, umuhinga mu binyabuzima akomoka mu Bwongereza, yabonye inyabune mu giti bita cork akoresheje rugagamisha.
They looked like rooms. He was the first person to observe dead cells	Bisa n’ivyumba. Niwe muntu wa mbere yabonye selile zapfuye.
Elements and compounds can move from one state to another and not change.	Ibintu birashobora guhindura kuva mubigumye bikaja nko mubiseseka ariko ntibihinduke.
Nitrogen as a gas still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser but the molecules are still the same.	Azote imeze nka gaze iguma ifise ibintu bimwe nka azote iseseka. Iyo yahindutse ikamera nk’ibiseseka iroroha ariko molekile ziguma ari zimwe.
Water is another example. The compound water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.	Amazi ni akandi karorero. Amazi agizwe na atome zibiri za idrojene na atome imwe ya ogisijeni.
It has the same molecular structure whether it is a gas, liquid, or solid.	Aguma afise molekile zimwe yaba ameze nka gaze, aseseka, canke yabaye ikibuye.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains the same.	Naho ashobora guhinduka ukwo ameze, ibiyagize vyo biguma ari vyabindi.
Time is something that is all around us, and affects everything we do, yet is difficult to understand.	Igihe n’ikintu kidukikije, kandi kigira ingaruka muvyo dukora vyose, arikokigoye gutahura.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars for thousands of years.	Igihe carizwe cane n’abagize amadini, filozofiya, n’ubumenyi haheze imyaka ibihumbi.
We experience time as a series of events passing from the future through the present to the past.	Twibaho igihe nk’urukurikirane rw'ibintu biva muri kazoza bikaja muri kahise biciye kuri kubu.
Time is also how we compare the duration (length) of events.	Igihe kandi ni uburyo tugereranya umwanya(umwanya wose) w’ivyabaye.
You can mark the passing of time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens again and again regularly.	Urashobora gushiraho wewe nyene igihe caheze ukoresheje kuraba ibintu vyabaye vyisubiriza. Ibintu vyisubiriza ni ibintu biba kandi bigasubira bikaba keshi.
Computers today are used to manipulate pictures and videos.	Mudasobwa uyumunsi zikoreshwa mu gukora amashusho n’amasanamu agenda.
Sophisticated animations can be constructed on computers, and this kind of animation is increasingly being used in television and films.	Animasiyo ihanitse irashobora kwubakwa kuri mudasobwa, kandi ubu bwoko bwa animasiyo bugenda bukoreshwa cane mu mboneshakure no mumareresi.
Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers to process and mix sounds together.	Umuziki ukunze gukorwa hakoreshejwe mudasobwa zihanitse mu gutunganya no kuvanga amajwi.
For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori people, who hunted giant birds called moas.	"Mu kinjana ca cumi n'icenda n'ica mirongibiri, abantu barameze igihe kirekire biyumvira ko abatanguye kuba muri Nouvelle Zélande bari Abamawori, bahiga ibinyoni amahero vyitwa ""moa""."
The theory then established the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia in a Great Fleet and took New Zealand from the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society.	Ivyo vyiyumviro vyaciye vyemeza yuko Abamawori bavuye muri Polineziya bari mu bwato bunini, bomora Abamoriyori baba i Nouvelle Zélande barahigarurira, batangura kurima.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of mainland Maori who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own distinctive, peaceful culture.	Ariko ibimenyamenya bishasha vyerekana ko Abamoriyori bari Abamawori bavuye mu karere nyamukuru ka Nouvelle Zélande baja kuba mu mazinga Chatham, barahava bagira imico bisangije y'abanyamahoro.
There was also another tribe on the Chatham islands these were Maori who migrated away from New Zealand.	Hariho uwundi mugwi w'abantu mu mazinga Chatham, bakaba bari Abamawori bahaje bavuye muri Nouvelle Zélande.
They called themselves the Moriori there were a few skirmishes and in the end, the Moriori were wiped out	Biyise Abamoriyori. Harabaye imishamirano mikeyi, amaherezo Abamoriyori barazimangana.
Individuals who had been involved for several decades helped us appreciate our strengths and passions while candidly assessing difficulties and even failures.	Abantu bari babigizemwo uruhara mu kiringo c'imyaka mirongo baradufashije kubona ubushobozi bwacu n'ishaka ryacu, barasuzuma n'ibitugora be n'ivyatunaniye, ata kurya umunwa.
While listening to individuals share their individual, family, and organizational stories, we gained valuable insight into the past and some of the personalities who influenced for good or ill the culture of the organization.	Igihe twumviriza abantu batwiganiye ivyo babonye ku giti cabo, mu muryango no mu mashirahamwe, vyaradufashije cane gutahura kahise n'abantu bamwebamwe bagize akosho keza canke kabi ku karanga k'ishirahamwe.
While understanding one’s history does not assume understanding of culture, it does at least help people gain a sense of where they fall within the history of the organization.	Naho gutahura kahise bitama bisigura ko utahura akaranga, birafasha abantu n'imiburiburi gutahura ikibanza cabo muri kahise k'ishirahamwe.
While assessing the successes and becoming aware of failures, individuals and the whole of the participating persons discover more deeply the values, mission, and driving forces of the organization.	Igihe bihweza ivyo bakoze neza bagatahura n'ivyo batakoze neza, umwe wese hamwe n'abandi bose bagize uruhara bararushiriza gutegera neza akarangamutima, intumbero n'inguvu vy'ishirahamwe.
In this instance, recalling previous instances of entrepreneurial behavior and resulting successes helped people to be open to new changes and new direction for the local church.	Ico gihe, kwibuka ingene imbere y'aho berekanye ishaka mu vyo gutunganya imigambi hamwe n'ivyiza vyavuyemwo, vyatumye abantu bitegurira kwakira amahinduka n'uburongozi bushasha ku bw'ishengero ryaho.
Such success stories lessened the fears of change, while creating positive inclinations toward change in the future.	Ivyo vyakunze muri kahise vyaragabanije ubwoba bw'amahinduka, bituma kandi bitegurira kwakira amahinduka azoza.
Convergent thinking patterns are problem solving techniques that unite different ideas or fields to find a solution.	Guhuriza hamwe ivyiyumviro ni ubuhinga bwo gutorera inyishu ikibazo bushira hamwe ivyiyumviro canke ibisata bitandukanye kugira butore inyishu.
The focus of this mindset is speed, logic and accuracy, also identification of facts, reapplying existing techniques, gathering information.	Ishimikiro ry’ubwo buhinga ni ukubanguka, ukwiyumvira mu buryo butumbereye n’ukutihenda, hamwe n’ukumenya ibintu ntaharirizwa, ugukoresha ubuhinga busanzwe buhari n'ugutororokanya amakuru.
The most important factor of this mindset is: there is only one correct answer. You only think of two answers, namely right or wrong.	Ikintu nyamukuru muri ubwo buryo bwo kubona ibintu ni uko hari inyishu imwe gusa y'ukuri. Wiyumvira inyishu zibiri gusa: ni co canke si co.
This type of thinking is associated with certain science or standard procedures.	Ubu buryo bw’ukwiyumvira bufitaniye isano n’ubuhinga bumwebumwe canke n’uburyo ibintu bikunda gukorwamwo.
People with this type of thinking have logical thinking, are able to memorize patterns, solve problems and work on scientific tests.	Abantu biyumvira muri buno buryo usanga biyumvira mu buryo butumbereye, bagafata ku mutwe uburyo ibintu bitunganijwe, bagatorera inyishu ingorane, bagakora n'ubushakashatsi mu vy’ubuhinga.
Humans are by far the most talented species in reading the minds of others.	Abantu ni vyo biremwa vya mbere bizi gutahura ibiri mu bwenge bw'ibindi.
That means we are able to successfully predict what other humans perceive, intend, believe, know or desire.	Ivyo bisigura ko dushobora kwiyumvira neza imbere y'igihe ivyo abandi bantu babona, bagamije, bemera, bazi canke bipfuza.
Among these abilities, understanding the intention of others is crucial. It allows us to resolve possible ambiguities of physical actions.	Muri ubwo bushobozi, ubwo gutahura ivyo abandi bagamije burahambaye cane. Buradufasha gutahura ivyo umuntu akoze vyoshobora gutahurwa nabi.
For example, if you were to see someone breaking a car window, you would probably assume he was trying to steal a stranger’s car.	Nk'ubu ubonye umuntu ariko aramena ikiyo c'umuduga, woca wibwira ko ashaka kwiba umuduga w'abandi.
He would need to be judged differently if he had lost his car keys and it was his own car that he was trying to break into.	Ntitwomubona nabi hamwe yoba ari uwataye imfunguruzo z'umuduga wiwe, akaba ariko agerageza kumena ngo yinjire mu muduga wiwe.
MRI is based on a physics phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).	"IRM ikoresha ubuhinga bwitwa ""résonance magnétique nucléaire"" (RMN) bwubuwe mu myaka ya 1930 na Felix Bloch (wo kuri Kaminuza ya Stanford) na Edward Purcell (wo kuri Kaminuza ya Harvard)."
In this resonance, magnetic field and radio waves cause atoms to give off tiny radio signals.	"Muri ubwo buhinga bwa ""résonance"", ivyo bita ""champ magnétique"" na ""ondes radio"" biratuma atome zirekura udushwarara inzatsa twitwa ""signaux radio""."
In the year 1970, Raymond Damadian, a medical doctor and research scientist, discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnosis.	"Mu 1970, Raymond Damadian, umuganga akaba n'umuhinga w'umushakashatsi, yarubuye ivyotuma ubuhinga bwa ""résonance magnétique"" bukoreshwa mu gupima indwara."
Four years later a patent was granted, which was the world's first patent issued in the field of MRI.	Haciye imyaka ine, yarahawe uburenganzira bwo kwitirirwa ubwo buhinga. Ni bwo bwa mbere bwatanzwe kw'isi yose mu bijanye na IRM.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first “whole-body” MRI scanner, which he called the ”Indomitable”.	Mu 1977, Dogoteri Damadian yararangije kwubaka sikaneri ya mbere ya IRM “y'umubiri-wose”, ayita ”Mutananirwa”.
Asynchronous communication encourages time for reflection and reaction to others.	Guhana amakuru n'umunyeshure ukwiwe bituma aronka umwanya wo kwiyumvira no kugira ico ashikirije abandi.
It allows students the ability to work at their own pace and control the pace of instructional information.	Bituma abanyeshure bashobora gukora ibintu ku muvuduko wabo, bakiga amakuru ku muvuduko bipfuza.
In addition, there are fewer time restrictions with the possibility of flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)	Vyongeye, habaye intambamyi nke z'umwanya igihe uba ushobora guhindura amasaha. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web allows learners to have access to information at all times.	Internet n'imbuga ngurukanabumenyi bituma abiga bashobora kuronka amakuru umwanya wose.
Students can also submit questions to instructors at any time of day and expect reasonably quick responses, rather than waiting until the next face-to-face meeting.	Abanyeshure barashobora no kubaza ibibazo abigisha aho bashakiye, bakitega kudateba cane kuronka inyishu, aho kurindira ko basubira kubonana n'abigisha amaso mu yandi.
The postmodern approach to learning offers the freedom from absolutes. There is no one good way to learn.	"Kwiga muri ubwo buryo bwitwa ""post-modernisme"" bituma yikuramwo ivyitwa ko ari ntabanduka. Nta buryo bumwe gusa bwo kwiga bubaho."
In fact, there is not one good thing to learn.Learning takes place in the experience between the learner and the knowledge presented.	Mbere ikintu ciza co kwiga si kimwe gusa. Kwiga biba igihe uwiga ari imbere y'ubumenyi ashikiriijwe.
Our current experience with all the do-it-yourself and information presenting, learning-based television shows illustrates this point.	Ivyo turabibona dufatiye ku vyo tumenyereye ubu mu bijanye no kwitunganiriza ibintu hamwe n'ibiganiro vyo ku mboneshakure biduha amakuru, bikaducisha ubwenge.
So many of us find ourselves watching a television show that informs us of a process or experience in which we will never participate or apply that knowledge.	Benshi muri twebwe birahika tukarorera ikiganiro co ku mboneshakure kitumenyesha ubuhinga kanaka canke ikintu cabaye tutazopfa tugizemwo uruhara canke ngo dukoreshemwo ubwo bumenyi.
We will never overhaul a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to examine ancient ruins, or remodel our neighbour's house.	Ntituzopfa dusambuye umuduga wacu wose ngo tuwukore, canke ngo twubake isoko ry'amazi mu kigo, ngo tuje muri Peru kwihweza ibisigarira vya kera canke ngo dusubiremwo inzu y'umubanyi.
Thanks to undersea fiber optic cable links to Europe and broadband satellite, Greenland is well connected with 93% of the population having internet access.	"Groenland, biciye ku ntsinga za ""fibre optiques"" zica mu mazi zikahahuza n'Uburaya hamwe n'ubuhinga bwa satelite, iraronka neza internet, ibice 93 kw'ijana vy'abaho bakaba bayikoresha."
Your hotel or hosts (if staying in a guesthouse or private home) will likely have wifi or an internet connected PC, and all settlements have an internet cafe or some location with public wifi.	Ihoteli urimwo canke aho watse indaro (kaba ari agahoteli canke umuhana w'umuntu) ushobora gusanga hari wifi canke inyabwonko ifise internet, kandi ibigwati vyose usanga bifise siberi canke ahandi hantu hari wifi rusangi.
"As mentioned above, though the word ""Eskimo"" remains acceptable in the United States, it is considered pejorative by many non-U.S. Arctic peoples, especially in Canada."	"Nk'uko twari twabivuze, naho ijambo ""Eskimo"" ricemewe muri Leta zunze ubumwe za Amerika, benshi mu batari Abanyamerika baba mu karere kegereye isonga rya ruguru ry'isi, canecane muri Kanada, babona ko riryotazanya."
While you may hear the word used by Greenlandic Natives, its use should be avoided by foreigners.	Naho ushobora kwumva iryo jambo rikoreshejwe n’imvukira za Gorowerande, abanyamahanga bakwiye kwirinda kurikoresha.
The native inhabitants of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq (plural Kalaallit), a Greenlander, in Greenland.	Abenegihugu kavukire ba Gorowerande biyita Inuit muri Kanada na Kalaalleq (mu bwinshi Kalaallit), canke umunyagoronerande muri Gorowerande.
"Crime, and ill-will toward foreigners in general, is virtually unknown in Greenland. Even in the towns, there are no ""rough areas."""	"Ubwicanyi no kudacungerwa bihagije ku banyamahanga muri rusangi ntibizwi gukorwa muri Greenland. Nubwo mubisagara, hatari ""ibibanza bigoye."""
Cold weather is perhaps the only real danger the unprepared will face.	Ikirere gikanye nico kibazo kibi c'ukuri gikomeye abatiteguye bashobora guhura.
If you visit Greenland during cold seasons (considering that the further north you go, the colder it will be), it is essential to bring warm enough clothing.	Iyo mutemberereye i Greenland mubihe vy' ubukonje (ariko iyo uduze m' uburaruko, niko hakanya), ni vyiza kwitwaza impuzu zishusha bikwiye.
The very long days in the summer can lead to problems getting sufficient sleep and associated health issues.	Imisi miremire cane y' ici irashobora gutuma haba ibibazo vy'ukuronka itiro rikwiye birikumwe n' ingorane z' ubuzima.
During the summer, also watch out for the Nordic mosquitoes. Although they do not transmit any diseases, they can be irritating.	Mugihe c' ici, mwiyubare kandi imibu yo m'uburaruko. Nubwo atangwara nimwe itera, irashobora kubasasata.
While San Francisco's economy is linked to it being a world-class tourist attraction, its economy is diversified.	Mugihe ubutunzi bwa San Francisco bufatanye n'ukuba ikibanza mpuzamakungu c'iratiro, ubutunzi bwayo buratandukanye.
The largest employment sectors are professional services, government, finance, trade, and tourism.	Igice k'inini c'ibisata bitanga akazi ni ibikorwa vy'abanyamyuga, intwaro, ubutunzi, ubudandaji, n'ingenzi.
Its frequent portrayal in music, films, literature and popular culture has helped make the city and its landmarks known throughout the world.	Iyerekanwa kenshi ryaco mumuziki, amareresi, inyandiko no mumigenzo vyarafashije igisagara n'ivyibutso vyaco kumenyekana kw'isi yose.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants, and top-notch convention facilities.	San Francisco yarateje imbere igice kinini c'inyubakwa z'iratiro hamwe n'amahoteri menshi, uburiro, hamwe n'inzu z'amanama zo kurwego rwambere.
San Francisco is also one of the best places in the nation for other Asian cuisine: Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese.	San Francisco ni kandi kimwe mu bibanza vyiza mugihugu kukundi guteka kwo muri Aziya: kwo muri Koreya, kwo muri Thai, kwo Mubuhinde, no Mubuyapani.
Traveling to Walt Disney World represents a major pilgrimage for many American families.	Gutemberera i Walt Disney World bifatwa nk'urugendo rukuru kumiryango myinshi y'Abanyamerika.
"The ""typical"" visit involves flying into Orlando International Airport, busing to an on-site Disney hotel, spending about a week without leaving Disney property, and returning home."	"Urugendo ""rumenyerewe"" rugizwe no kuja Kukibuga Mpuzamakungu c'i Orlando, ukugenda n'ibisi mw'ihoteri yaho i Disney, kumara hafi indwi atakuva munyubakwa za Disney, hamwe no gusubira imuhira."
"There are infinite variations possible, but this remains what most people mean when they talk of ""going to Disney World""."	"Hari insiguro nyinshi cane gose zishoboka, gusa iki gisigara arico abantu benshi baba bashatse gusigura iyo bavuze ""kuja i Disney World""."
Many tickets sold online through auction websites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day park-hopper tickets.	Amatike menshi agurishirijwe k'umurongo ngurukanabumenyi hakoreshejwe imbuga ngurukana bumenyi zo kugurisha icamunara nka eBay canke Craigslist aba ari itike za parike z'iminsi myinshi zakoreshejwe igice.
While this is a very common activity, it is prohibited by Disney: the tickets are non-transferable.	Naho iki ari igikorwa kimenyerwe cane, kirabujijwe na Disney: amatike ntashobora guhanahanwa.
Any camping below the rim in Grand Canyon requires a backcountry permit.	Gucumbika ukwo ari kwo kwose musi y’uruzitiro i Grand Canyon bisaba uruhusha rwo gucumbika hagati mu gihugu.
Permits are limited to protect the canyon, and become available on the 1st day of the month, four months prior to the start month.	Impusha ni nke ku mvo zo gukingira ikiyaya, zikaboneka ku munsi wa 1 w’ukwezi, amezi ane imbere y'ukwezi batangurirako.
Thus, a backcountry permit for any start date in May becomes available on 1 Jan.	Rero, uruhusha rwo gucumbika mu gihugu hagati ku musi uwo ari wo wose wo gutangurirako muri Rusama rushobora kuboneka kuva itariki 1 Nzero.
Space for the most popular areas, such as the Bright Angel Campground adjacent to Phantom Ranch, generally fill up by the requests received on first date they are opened to reservations.	Ibibanza vyo mu bice bizwi cane nka Bright Angel Campgound iri hafi ya Phantom Ranch, mu bisanzwe bifatwa vyose n'ababisaba kw’itariki ya mbere batangurirako kubikisha ibibanza.
There are a limited number permits reserved for walk-in requests available on a first come, first served basis.	Hari igitigiri ntarengwa c’impusha zihabwa abisabira kugendagenda, zikaba zihabwa abatanga abandi kuhashika.
Entering Southern Africa by car is an amazing way to see all the region's beauty as well as to get to places off the normal tourist routes.	Ukwinjira muri Afurika y'Epfo n'imodoka ni uburyo bwiza cane bwo kubona ubwiza bwose bwako karere hamwe no kuja mubibanza bitamenyerewe mu ngendo z'ingenzi.
This can be done in a normal car with careful planning but a 4x4 is highly advised and many locations are only accessible with a high wheel base 4x4.	Ibi bishobora gukorwa mumodoka isanzwe hamwe n'ugutegekanya kwiza mugabo i 4x4 irahanuwe cane kandi ibice vyinshi bishikirwa gusa na 4x4 z'uburebure buri hejuru.
Keep in mind while planning that although Southern Africa is stable not all neighboring countries are.	Gumiza mumutwe mugihe co gutegekanya ko naho Afurika y'Epfo itekanye atari ibihugu bigenzi vyose bimeze uko.
Visa requirements and costs vary from nation to nation and are affected by the country you come from.	Ibisabwa hamwe n'ibiciro vya viza bitandukana igihugu kukindi kandi biraterwa n'igihugu uvuyemwo.
Each country also has unique laws requiring what emergency items need to be in the car.	Igihugu cose kandi gifise amategeko cisangije asaba ibikoresho vy'ubutabazi bwihuse bibwirizwa kuba biri mumodoka.
Victoria Falls is a town in the western portion of Zimbabwe, across the border from Livingstone, Zambia, and near Botswana.	Victoria Falls ni igisagara c' igice c' uburengero bwa Zimbabwe, kurundi ruhande n' urubibe rwa Livingstone, na Zambia, hamwe n' impande ya Botswana.
The town lies immediately next to the falls, and they are the major attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers both adventure seekers and sightseers plenty of opportunities for a longer stay.	Igisagara kiri neza na neza impande y' amasumo y' amazi, kandi arakwega ingenzi, ariko icokibanza c' iratiro kizwi kiraraha inkerebutsi hamwe n' ingenzi akaryo ko kuhamara umwanya muremure.
In the rainy season (November to March), the water volume will be higher and the Falls will be more dramatic.	Mugihe c' imvura (Munyonyo na Ntwarante), amazi araba menshi cane hama Amasumo agatera ubwoba gose.
You are guaranteed to get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the trails winding near the Falls.	Muba mubwirizwa kujoba iyo muciye kukiraro canke iyo muciye mutuyira turi impande y' Amasumo.
On the other hand, it is precisely because the volume of water is so high that your viewing of the actual Falls will be obscured—by all the water!	Kurundi ruhande, ni kubera nyene amazi aba yaduze muburebure ukubona amasumo ubwayo aba yijimye—nayo mazi yose.
Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 may be the most famous of the tombs in the Valley, the scene of Howard Carter's 1922 discovery of the almost intact royal burial of the young king.	Imva ya Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 ishobora kuba imva izwi cane mu mva zo mukabande, ireresi y' ubuvumbuzi bwa Howard Carter mu 1922 uruhafu rw' ibwami rukimeze neza rw' umwami akiri muto.
Compared to most of the other royal tombs, however, the tomb of Tutankhamun is barely worth visiting, being much smaller and with limited decoration.	Ugereranije n' izindi mva nyinshi z' ibwami, vyongeye, imva ya Tutankhamun biragoye kuyigendera, ni nto cane hamwe nuko idasharije cane.
Anyone interested in seeing evidence of the damage to the mummy done during attempts to remove it from the coffin will be disappointed as only the head and shoulders are visible.	Umuntu wese yumva yoraba ibimenyetso vy' ukwononekara kw' ikiziga bitewe n' amageragezwa yo gukurayo isandugu azobabara kuko ni umutwe n' ibitugu vyonyene vyaboneka.
The fabulous riches of the tomb are no longer in it, but have been removed to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.	Ubutunzi budasanzwe bw' uruhafu ntibwarimwo, ariko vyarungitswe mukibanza c' iratiro i Kayiro.
Visitors with limited time would be best to spend their time elsewhere.	Ingenzi zifise umwanya muto vyoba vyiza zimaze umwanya ahandi.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This hilltop temple was built at the end of the 9th century, during the reign of King Yasovarman.	Phnom Krom, ku birometero 12 m' ubumanuko bushira uburengero bwa Siem Reap. Ugwo rusengero rwo kugasongero rwubatswe mumpera y' ikinjana c'i 9, ku ntwaro y' Umwami Yasovarman.
The gloomy atmosphere of the temple and the view over the Tonle Sap lake make the climb to the hill worthwhile.	Ikirere kibabaje c' urusengero n'ingene ubona kukiyaga ca Tonle Sap bituma kuduga k' umusozi bikwiye.
A visit to the site can be conveniently combined with a boat trip to the lake.	Ukugendera ikibanza bishobora kuba vyiza bijanye nukuja mubwato ugana kukiyaga.
The Angkor Pass is needed to enter the temple so do not forget to bring your passport along when heading to Tonle Sap.	Ugwinjiriro rwa Angkor rurakenewe kugira winjire m' urusengero, ubwo rero ntiwibagire mureke arengane yawe mugihe mwinjiriye ahagana i Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, though most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as Israel's capital.	Yerusalemu n' umugwa mukuru kandi kikaba n' igisagarsa gikuru ca Isirayeli, nubwo ibindi bihugu vyinshi hamwe n' Umuryango w' Ibihugu bitaremeza ko ari umugwa mukuru wa Isirayeli.
The ancient city in the Judean Hills has a fascinating history spanning thousands of years.	Igisagara ca kera c' Imisozi ya Yuda gifise akahise gatangaje gafata ibihumbi vy' imyaka.
The city is holy to the three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious, and cultural center.	Igisagara ni ceranda kuma dini atatu yemera Imana imwe - Abayuda, aba Kristu, aba Isilamu, kandi kikaba ihuriro ry' ukwemera, amadini hamwe n' akaranga.
Due to the religious significance of the city, and in particular the many sites of the Old City area, Jerusalem is one of the main tourist destinations in Israel.	Kubera insiguro y'amadini y'igisagara, hamwe na cane cane ubwinshi bw' ibibanza Bishaje vy' Igisagara, Yeruzalemu ni hamwe mubibanza bikuru vy' ingenzi vya Isirayeli.
Jerusalem has many historic, archeological and cultural sites, along with vibrant and crowded shopping centers, cafés, and restaurants.	Yeruzalemu ifise ibibanza vyinshi vya kera, ibisigaratongo hamwe n'ibice vy'uturanga, vyongeye amahuriro y' ubudandaji yuzuye kandi akora cane, amakawa, hamwe n' uburiro.
Ecuador requires that Cuban citizens receive an invitation letter prior to entering Ecuador through international airports or frontier admission points.	Ekwateri isaba abenegihugu ba Cuban guhabwa ugwete rw' ubutumire imbere yuko binjira muri Ekwateri baciye mubibuga vy' indege mpuza makungu canke aho babemerera kumbibe.
This letter must be legalized by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and comply with certain requirements.	Ugo rwete rutegerezwa kwemezwa n' Ubushikiranganji bw' Ubudandaji n' Amahanga bwo muri Ekwateri, kandi rikubahiriza ibisabwa bimwe bimwe.
These requirements are designed to provide an organized migratory flow between both countries.	Ayo ma tegeko acungera urugero rw' abimukira rwatunganijwe hagati y' ibihugu bibiri.
Cuban citizens who are US green card holders should visit an Ecuadorian Consulate to obtain an exemption to this requirement.	Abene gihugu ba Cuban bafise ikarata y' ugwatsi rutoto ya Leta Zunze Ubumwe barashobora kugendera Ubuserukizi bwa Ekwateri kugira barekurirwe kudakenera ivyo bisabwa.
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your travel dates. A round/onward trip ticket is needed to prove the length of your stay.

Canyoning (or: canyoneering) is about going in a bottom of a canyon, which is either dry or full of water.	Ivyo bita canyoning ni ukumanuka epfo mu mwonga wumye canke wuzuyemwo amazi.
Canyoning combines elements from swimming, climbing and jumping--but requires relatively little training or physical shape to get started (compared to rock climbing, scuba diving or alpine skiing, for example).	Ukwo kumanuka mu mwonga kujamwo ivyo kwoga, kwurira no gusimba. Mugabo kubitangura bisaba ko bakwigisha gatoyi canke ko uba unonotse (ugereranije no kwurira umusozi w'urutare, kwibira mu mazi ufise ibigufasha guhema canke kugira ivya ski yo mu misozi, nk'akarorero).

Internationally, there are nearly 200 running tour organizations. Most of them operate independently.	Kw'isi yose, hari amashirahamwe hafi 20 atunganya ivyo kwiruka. Menshi arigenga.
The Global Running Tours successor, Go Running Tours networks dozens of sightrunning providers on four continents.	Go Running Tours, iryasubiriye Global Running Tours, rihuza imigwi itari mike y'abakora ivyo kwiruka babijanisha no gutembera, ku migabane ine y'isi.

There are many things you have to take into consideration before and when you travel somewhere.	Imbere yo gufata urugendo n'igihe ururiko, hari ibintu vyinshi ukwiye kwiyumvira.
"When you travel, expect things not to be like they are ""back home"". Manners, laws, food, traffic, lodging, standards, language and so on will to some extent differ from where you live."	"Ufashe urugendo, niwitege ko ibintu biza kuba bitandukanye n'uko biri ""iwanyu"". Ingene abaho bifata, amategeko, imfungurwa, uruja n'uruza, uburaro, ivyo bisunga, ururimi n'ibindi, usanga bitandukanye n'ivy'iwanyu ku rugero kanaka."
This is something you always need to keep in mind, to avoid disappointment or perhaps even distaste over local ways to do things.	Ico ni ikintu ukwiye kwama wibuka kugira woye kuvunika umutima canke mbere ngo ushishwe n'ingene abaho bakora ibintu.
Travel agencies have been around since the 19th century. A travel agent is usually a good option for a journey which extends beyond a traveller's previous experience of nature, culture, language or low-income countries.	Amashirahamwe atunganya ingendo yamyeho kuva nko mu kinjana ca 19. Uwukora mu vy'ingendo kenshi aba kirumara igihe ruba ari urugendo rutandukanye n'izo wari umaze kugira, mu bijanye n'akarere uzoba ugiyemwo, imico kama, ururimi canke ibihugu bikenye.
Although most agencies are willing to take on most regular bookings, many agents specialise in particular types of travel, budget ranges or destinations.	Naho amashirahamwe atunganya ingendo usanga ashobora gutunganya ingendo zisanzwe nka zose, menshi usanga yibanda ku bwoko kanaka bw'ingendo, ku bantu bafise amikoro kanaka no ku bihugu kanaka bajamwo.
It can be better to use an agent who frequently books similar trips to yours.	Vyiza wokwitura abatunganya ingendo bama batunganya ingendo zimeze nk'urwo wipfuza kugira.
Take a look at what trips the agent is promoting, whether on a website or in a shop window.	Tereza akajisho ku rubuga rwabo canke kw'idirisha ry'aho bakorera, urabe ingendo bahayanisha.
If you want to see the world on the cheap, for necessity, lifestyle or challenge, there are some ways to do that.	Nimba wipfuza gutembera utarishe menshi kubera amikoro make, canke kubera ko ari ko ubayeho canke wipfuza kubigerageza, hari uburyo bumwebumwe wobikora.
Basically, they fall into two categories: Either work while you travel or try and limit your expenses. This article is focused on the latter.	Muri make, buri mu migwi ibiri: wokora akazi uri ku rugendo, canke ukagerageza kuziganya amahera. Iki kiganiro gishimika kuri ico ca kabiri.
For those willing to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability to push expenses down close to zero, see minimum budget travel.	Wipfuza guheba ivyo kworoherwa, umwanya n'ivyo umenyereye kugira uzokoreshe amahera make ashoboka, raba ivyo kugira ingendo za make.
The advice assumes that travellers do not steal, trespass, participate in the illegal market, beg, or otherwise exploit other people for their own gain.	Mu gutanga iyo mpanuro, vyitezwe ko uwufata urugendo atiba, adahonyanga amategeko, ataja mu vya magendo, adasega canke ngo arye imitsi abandi ku nyungu yiwe bwite.
An immigration checkpoint is usually the first stop when disembarking from a plane, a ship, or another vehicle.	Igihe wururutse indege, ubwato canke iyindi ngendeshwa, kenshi ahantu ha mbere ushikira ni ku baraba ivy'imipaka.
In some cross-border trains inspections are done on the running train and you should have valid ID with you when boarding one of those trains.	Mu magariyamoshi amwamwe ajabuka imbibe, isuzuma ry'ivya ngombwa ribera mw'igariyamoshi iri ku rugendo, ukaba ukwiye kuba ufise ibikuranga bitomoye igihe wurira mwene iyo gariyamoshi.
On night sleeper trains, passports may be collected by the conductor so that you do not have your sleep interrupted.	Mw'igariyamoshi ifise uburyamo, uwuyitwara arashobora kubasaba pasiporo kugira ntibirirwe barakuvyura.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you must register your presence and address where you are staying with the local authorities.	Kwiyandikisha ni ikindi gisabwa mu bijanye na viza. Mu bihugu bimwebimwe, usabwa kumenyesha abajejwe intwaro ko uba mu karere batwara, ukababwira na aderese y'aho uba.
This might require filling out a form with the local police or a visit to the immigration offices.	Hari igihe bisaba ko wuzuza urukaratasi ku gituro c'inyamiramabi canke ukaja ku biro biraba abinjira n'abasohoka mu gihugu.
In many countries with such a law, local hotels will handle the registration (make sure to ask).	Mu bihugu vyinshi bifise mwene iryo tegeko, amahoteri usanga ari yo akora ivyo vyo kwiyandikisha (wibuke kubaza).
In other cases, only those staying outside of tourist accommodations need to register.  However, this makes the law much more obscure, so find out beforehand.	Ahandi usanga abatashikiye mu buraro bw'ingenzi ari bo gusa bakenera kwiyandikisha. Kubera ko ivyo bituma itegeko ridatomoka, vyiza rero worondera amakuru kare.
Architecture is concerned with the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of a place is often a tourist attraction in its own right.	Architecture iraba ibijanye n'ugutegura imigero y'inyubakwa no kwubaka. Ingene inyubakwa yubatswe ubwavyo ni ikintu gikunda gukwega ingenzi.
Many buildings are quite beautiful to look at and the view from a tall building or from a cleverly-positioned window can be a beauty to behold.	Inyubakwa nyinshi usanga ziteye igomwe, kandi birashobora kuryoha kwitegereza ahantu uhagaze mw'igorofa ndende canke kw'idirisha ryashizwe ahantu hiyumviriwe neza.
Architecture overlaps considerably with other fields including urban planning, civil engineering, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design.	Ivyo gutunganya imigero no kwubaka birinjiranamwo cane n'ibindi bisata, nk'ivyo gutunganya igisagara, gutunganya inyubakwa za leta, ivy'utugenegene, ivy'ugushariza mu nzu no gutunganya neza ubusitani.
Given how remote many of the pueblos are, you won't be able to find a significant amount of nightlife without traveling to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.	Kubera ukuntu ibigwati vy'Abanyamerika b'imvukira biri kure, ntuzoronka aho wisamariza neza mw'ijoro utagiye i Albuquerque canke i Santa Fe.
However, nearly all of the casinos listed above serve drinks, and several of them bring in name-brand entertainment (primarily the large ones immediately surrounding Albuquerque and Santa Fe).	Ariko ibibanza vy'amakazino nka vyose vyavuzwe haruguru bitanga ibinyobwa, kandi mu bitari bike muri vyo usanga hari ivyo kwisamaza bisohorwa n'amashirahamwe kanaka (canecane ibibanza bininibinini vyegereye Albuquerque na Santa Fe).
Beware: small-town bars here are not always good places for the out-of-state visitor to hang out.	Uraba maso: ububare bwaho bwo mu dusagara dutoduto ntibwama ari bwiza ku ngenzi zivuye mu yindi leta.
For one thing, northern New Mexico has significant problems with drunk driving, and the concentration of intoxicated drivers is high close to small-town bars.	Kimwe coco, mu buraruko bwa Nouveau-Mexique hari ingorane zikomeye zijanye n'abatwara umuduga baborewe, kandi benshi muri bo ni abo mu micungararo y'ububare bwo mu dusagara dutoyi.
Unwanted murals or scribble is known as graffiti.	Amashusho canke ivyandiko bidakenewe vyo ku ruhome vyitwa graffiti.
While it's far from a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate it with youth vandalizing public and private property using spray paint.	Naho atari ikintu ca vuba cane, abantu benshi bashobora kuba babisanisha na birya urwaruka rukora rwonona ibibanza rusangi n'ivya barundi mu gupuriza irangi.
"However, nowadays there are established graffiti artists, graffiti events and ""legal"" walls. Graffiti paintings in this context often resemble artworks rather than illegible tags."	"Ariko rero, muri iki gihe hari abahinga ba mwene ayo mashusho yo ku ruhome, imisi mikuri ihariwe ayo mashusho hamwe n'impome ""zemewe n'amategeko"". Amashusho yo ku ruhome nk'ayo usanga kenshi asa n'utugenegene aho gusa n'ivy'abiyadukiza."

MetroRail has two classes on commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also called First Class) and Metro (called Third Class).	MetroRail ifise ubwoko bubiri bw'ivyicaro mu magariyamoshi yunguruza abakozi i Cape Town no mu micungararo yaho: MetroPlus (ari wo Mugwi wa mbere) na Metro (ari wo Mugwi wa gatatu).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded but slightly more expensive, though still cheaper than normal metro tickets in Europe.	Muri MetroPlus hameze neza kandi abantu ntibuzurana mugabo harazimvye gato, naho hazimbutse gusumba amatike asanzwe ya gariyamoshi z'i Europe.
Every train has both MetroPlus and Metro coaches; the MetroPlus coaches are always on the end of the train nearest Cape Town.	Igariyamoshi yose irafise ibiduga vya MetroPlus n'ivya Metro. Ibiduga vya MetroPlus vyama biri ku mpera ya gariyamoshi yegereye cane Cape Town.

For those unfamiliar with medical jargon, the words infectious and contagious have distinct meanings.	Kubatazi imvugo y' ikiganga, umajambo igwaza na yandukira afise insiguro zitandukanye.
An infectious disease is one that is caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, bacterium, fungus or other parasites.	Indwara igwaza ni imwe iterwa n' ikintu kigwaza nka virusi, bagiteri, ikizinu canke akandi gakoko.
A contagious disease is a disease which is easily transmitted by being in the vicinity of an infected person.	Indwara yandukira ni indwara ihahanahnwa vyoroshe iyo hagize uwegera uwuyigwaye.
Many governments require visitors entering, or residents leaving, their countries to be vaccinated for a range of diseases.	Amareta menshi ategeka ko ingenzi zinjira, canke abahaba basohotse, ibihugu vyabo bibanje kwicandagisha ingwara zitandukanye.

The South Pole Traverse (or Highway) is a 1600 km trail from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the Pole.	South Pole Traverse (canke Highway) ni akayira k' ibiro metero 1600 kuva Kugituro McMurdo Kukiyaga ca Ross muri Pole.
It's compacted snow with crevasses filled in and marked by flags. It can only be traveled by specialized tractors, hauling sleds with fuel and supplies.	Ni urubura rufatanijwe n' utunogo twuzuye kandi turangwa n' amabendera. Hashobora kuzungurukwa n'amatingatibga yabigenewe, bakwega utuduga two k' urubura turimwo ibitoro hamwe n' ivya nkenerwa.
These aren't very nimble so the trail has to take a long swerve around the Transantarctic Mountains to come onto the plateau.	Izo ntizoroshe nico gituma inzira itegerezwa kuzunguruka Imisozi ica muri Antarctic kugira ngo ishike k' umugwa.
The most common cause for accidents in winter is slippery roads, pavements (sidewalks) and especially steps.	Ikintu gikunze gutera amasanganya mugihe c'urubura rwinshi ni amabarabara anyerera, amapave (impande y' inzira) cane cane mu ngendo.
At a minimum, you need footwear with suitable soles. Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, even some winter boots are deficient.	Nimiburiburi, mukenera ibirato bifise musi hakozwe kuburyo bwiza. Ibirato vyo muci biranyerera cane k' urubura, kandi n' ibirato vya sekuro vyo mugihe gikanye birakena.
The pattern should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material soft enough in cold temperatures.	Icitwazo gitegerezwa kuba kirekire bikwiye, mm 5 (1/5 inch) canke zirenga, hamwe n' igikoresho coroshe bikwiye mugihe c' ubukanye.
Some boots have studs and there is studded add-on equipment for slippery conditions, suitable for most shoes and boots, for the heels or heels and sole.	Ibirato bimwe bimwe vya sekuro birafise ibintu bimeze nk' amenyo kandi hariho n' ikindi gikoresho cishimikizwa mugihe hanyerera, kigenewe ibirato bimwe bimwe hamwe nabimwe vya sekuro, vy'amataro canke amataro n'isemere.
Heels should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is often scattered on roads or paths to improve traction.	Itaro ritegerezwa kuba rigufi kandi ryagutse. Umusenyi, igaraviyo, canke umunyu (calcium chloride) biba bisanzaye kuma barabara canke kutuyira kugira bongereze ugukwega.
Avalanches are not an abnormality; steep slopes can hold only so much slow, and the excess volumes will come down as avalanches.	Urubura runini ruhenuka bukwi na bukwi si ibidasanzwe; utudugo tugumye dushobora kugumya buke buke gusa, hama ubunini burengako buca bugwa hasi nk'Urubura runini ruhenuka bukwi na bukwi.
The problem is that snow is sticky, so it needs some triggering to come down, and some snow coming down can be the triggering event for the rest.	Ikibazo nuko urubura ruhomako, biba bisaba imbarutso zimwe kugira rumanuke hasi, hama urubura ruke ruvuyeko rushobora kuba imbarutso y'ibindi vyose bishika.
Sometimes the original trigging event is the sun warming the snow, sometimes some more snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often a human.	Rimwe na rimwe igishika ubwambere nk'imbarutso ni izuba rirushusha urubura, rimwe na rimwe ukugwa kw'urundi rubura, rimwe na rimwe ibindi kama bishika, cane cane umuntu.
A tornado is a spinning column of very low-pressure air, which sucks the surrounding air inward and upward.	Ikivumbuzi ni inkingi nyamukuru y' umuyaga uzunguruka ku nguvu zikeya, co cikwegeramwo umuyaga ugikikije hama kikawuduza hejuru.
They generate high winds (often 100-200 miles/hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, carrying them as the tornado moves.	Bitanguza imiyaga miremire (kenshi intambuko 100 canke 200 kwisaha) kandi birashobora guterura ibintu biremereye mumuyaga, hama bikavyunguruza uko ikivumbuzi ciyunguruza.
"They begin as funnels descending from storm clouds, and become ""tornadoes"" when they touch the ground."	"Bitangura nk' imibirikira imanuka iva mumiyaga y'gicu, hama bikaba ""ibivumbuzi"" mugihe bikoze kwisi."
Personal VPN (virtual private network) providers are an excellent way of circumventing both political censorship and commercial IP-geofiltering.	Abatanga VPN kugiti cabo (virtual private network) ni uburyo bwiza bwo kwirinda vyompi ugukumirwa gufatiye kumvo za politike hamwe n'ihagarikwa rifatiye mukarere k'ubudandaji.
They are superior to web proxies for several reasons: They re-route all Internet traffic, not only http.	Zirarengeye web proxies kubera imvo nyinshi: Zirahindura inzira yose y'abakoresha ubuhinga ngurukana bumenyi, atari http yonyene.
They normally offer higher bandwidth and better quality of service. They are encrypted and thus harder to spy on.	Mubisanzwe zitanga umuyoboro urengana uri hejuru hamwe n'ibikorwa vyiza gusumba. Ziba zikoresha ibanga nico gituma bitoroshe kuzigirako amatohoza.

Fewer than a thousand cases have ever been reported in humans, but some of them have been fatal.	Uturorero duke tudashika igihumbi nitwo tumaze gushikirizwa mu bantu, ariko tumwe muri two twagize ingaruka mbi zikomeye.
Most have involved people who work with poultry, but there is also some risk to birdwatchers.	Twinshi twari twerekeye abantu bakorera mu nkoko, ariko hariho n'ingorane ku basamarira inyoni.
Typical for Norway are steep fjords and valleys that suddenly give way to a high, more or less even plateau.	Nk'uko bimenyerewe muri Norveje hari ama fjord n'imyonga bihanamye bishikana n'ingoga mu biyaya biri hejuru, bigoroye bukebuke canke cane.
"These plateaus are often referred to as ""vidde"" meaning a wide, open treeless space, a boundless expanse."	"Ivyo biyaya kenshi bavyita ""vidde"" bisiguye ikibanza cagutse, cugurutse kitagiramwo ibiti, c'ubwaguke butagira imbibe."
